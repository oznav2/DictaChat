# Project Status

## 🚀 Recent Achievements

- **Enterprise UTF-8/Hebrew Support**: Implemented `dir="auto"` for proper RTL rendering and native Unicode handling.
- **"Best-in-Class" Tool Strategy**:
  - Implemented hardcoded prioritization: `Perplexity` (100) > `SequentialThinking` (95) > `Tavily/Fetch` (90) > `Google` (10).
  - Enforced "Reasoning First" with `sequentialthinking` step limits (5 steps) to prevent context overflow.
  - Added Hebrew intent detection to map "חפש" (Search) to Tavily and "מחקר" (Research) to Perplexity.
- **MCP Tool Ecosystem**:
  - Audited and categorized 80+ tools into `mcp_tools_list.md`.
  - Expanded `toolFilter.ts` categories to include `reasoning` and `utility`.
- **Reliability Enhancements**:
  - Boosted `fetch` tool priority to 90 based on reliability feedback.
  - Implemented loop detection (10-round max) in `runMcpFlow.ts`.
  - Added message caching (60s TTL) for multimodal processing.
- **Critical Fixes & Risk Mitigation**:
  - **Code Generation Safety**: Disabled space-collapsing regex in `runMcpFlow.ts` to preserve code indentation (Python/YAML safety).
  - **Type/HTML Safety**: Relaxed `toolArgumentSanitizer.ts` to allow angle brackets, preventing destruction of Generic types (e.g., `List<String>`) and HTML tags.
  - **JSON Reliability**: Switched from `jsonRepair` (naive) to `jsonExtractor` (robust) in `runMcpFlow.ts` for tool call parsing, preventing false positives in JSON structure fixing.
  - **Enterprise Hardening (New)**:
    - **Production URL Security**: Implemented `MCP_PRODUCTION_URL_ALLOWLIST` enforcement in `urlSafetyEnhanced.ts` to prevent SSRF in production while allowing flexibility in dev.
    - **Streaming Robustness**: Replaced heuristic-based streaming suppression with signature-based detection (`findToolCallsPayloadStartIndex`) to prevent UI hangs on JSON-like content.
    - **Argument Parsing Tolerance**: Switched to `JSON5` for tool argument parsing to handle "almost JSON" (unquoted keys, trailing commas) gracefully.
    - **Non-Destructive Sanitization**: Refactored `toolArgumentSanitizer.ts` to warn instead of strip legitimate patterns (like `${...}` in templates), using `lastIndex` reset for safety.
    - **Preservation of User Data**: Scoped `tool_calls` cleanup in `runMcpFlow.ts` to strictly target tool JSON, preventing accidental deletion of user-provided JSON code blocks.
    - **Hebrew Support**: Removed Hebrew-specific stop sequences that were causing premature truncation of summaries.
    - **Render Security**: Hardened Mermaid diagrams (`securityLevel: 'strict'`) and HTML rendering (`DOMPurify` for `<details>`/`<summary>`) to prevent XSS and injection attacks.
    - **Log Redaction**: Implemented structured log redaction and production-safe log truncation (500 chars) in `runMcpFlow.ts` to prevent data leaks.
  - **Tool Call Streaming Fix**: Fixed a critical bug in `runMcpFlow.ts` where "Thinking" blocks were cut off or tool call JSON leaked to the UI. Implemented proper buffer flushing and strict token-based stream tracking.
  - **UI Assets Path Fix**: Corrected `PUBLIC_APP_ASSETS` in `docker-compose.yml` to match the physical `static/chatui` directory, resolving missing logo/icons (404s).
  - **Mermaid Rendering Fix**:
    - **Vite Configuration**:
      - Excluded `mermaid` from optimization to prevent build errors.
      - Aliased `dayjs` to `dayjs/esm` to fix default export issues.
      - Included `@braintree/sanitize-url` in optimization to fix named export issues from CommonJS dependencies.
      - **Type Safety**: Fixed implicit `any` errors in `vite.config.ts`.
    - **Component Logic**:
      - Refactored `MermaidBlock.svelte` to use dynamic import (`await import('mermaid')`) to prevent SSR crashes.
      - Implemented reactive state (`$state`) for the Mermaid instance to ensure reliable rendering.
      - Configured `useMaxWidth: false` to prevent large diagrams from failing or being squashed.
      - Restored `securityLevel: 'loose'` and detailed error reporting to handle complex diagrams and provide useful feedback.
      - **Robust Auto-Fix**: Implemented tokenizer-based regex replacement in `fixMermaidCode` to correctly handle nested parentheses and quoted strings (e.g., `shape ("k")`) without over-fixing.
      - **Enhanced Auto-Fix**: Added support for arrow labels (`|...|`), newline handling (`\n` -> `<br/>`), and `mermaid.parse()` pre-validation to catch and fix errors that `render()` swallows (displaying only an error diagram).

- **Documentation**:
  - Updated `CLAUDE.md` to reflect `runMcpFlow` architecture, consolidated `.env`, and recent status.
  - Ensured `CLAUDE.md` is <40k chars (condensed from 73k).

- **Cleanup**:
  - Removed unused `gibberish.ts` (dead code) to simplify codebase.
  - Updated `runmcpflow_overview.md` to reflect actual safety mechanisms (length checks) instead of deprecated gibberish detection.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit (Port 8004)
- **Gateway**: Go-based Proxy (Port 8002)
- **Inference**: Llama.cpp Server (Port 5002) running DictaLM-3.0 (24B)
- **Database**: MongoDB (Conversations), PostgreSQL (Gateway Config)
- **Cache**: Redis (Rate Limiting)

## 📅 Next Steps: Context Management (24GB VRAM Limit)

The current challenge is maintaining multi-turn chat context without OOM crashes.

**Proposed Plan:**

1.  **Sliding Window with Semantic Summarization**:
    -   Implement a token estimator in `textGeneration`.
    -   Trigger summarization when context > 6000 tokens.
    -   Compress older turns into a persistent `summary` field in MongoDB.
    -   Inject summary as a `<system_note>` into the prompt.
2.  **State Management**:
    -   Update `Conversation` schema to include `summary`.
    -   Use Redis to lock conversations during summarization.
3.  **Sequential Thinking Safety**:
    -   Enforce strict step limits (already done).
    -   Truncate intermediate thinking steps in the prompt history, keeping only the final conclusion for older turns.

## 📝 Pending Tasks

- [ ] Implement `ContextManager` service.
- [ ] Add `summary` field to MongoDB schema.
- [ ] Create summarization prompt template.
- [ ] Verify token counting logic.
