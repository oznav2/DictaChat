i want you to read my runmcpflow and any dependant files. `\home\ilan\BricksLLM\runmcpflow_overview_gemini.md` `\home\ilan\BricksLLM\STATUS.md` . i want you to generate a file called clawd_memory.md in which you will have a comprehensive and detailed plan how to transform my memory system to be : 1. proactive. **Reactive vs. Proactive:** Standard assistants wait for prompts. i want the memory system to simulate anticipation to stay ahead of the user workflow.
2. **Execution Focus:** i want my runmcpflow to prioritize the assistant output and bottlenecks.
i also want the memory system to achieve full 3. **Contextual Persistence:**. the assistant should maintain a continuous focus on the user specific goals (AI Content Creation) to ensure momentum.
while already many parts of the memory system are implmeneted and designed to remember i want to enhance it to also anticipate, and assist - not wait. i want you to plan how to wire my current memory system without omiting or breaking it to curated memory system that is based on writing the memories to files. the principle i want to achieve is Text > Brain. 📝 Write It Down - No “Mental Notes”!
Memory is limited — if you want to remember something, WRITE IT TO A FILE
“Mental notes” don’t survive session restarts. Files do. 

the memory system currently running and implemented relies on json and mental notes which are derived from gating and prompts. 

i want to enhance my memory system to harness all the clever methods and codelogic to a series of local files that will enhance the memory and exprience.

every chat with the assistant should be considered as session.
on every session
Read SOUL.md — this is who you are
Read USER.md — this is who you’re helping
Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (today + yesterday) for recent context
If in MAIN SESSION (direct chat with your human): Also read MEMORY.md

When someone says “remember this” → update memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md or relevant file
When you learn a lesson → update DICTA.md, TOOLS.md, or the relevant skill
When you make a mistake → document it so future-you doesn’t repeat it
