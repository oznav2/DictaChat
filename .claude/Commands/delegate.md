Explore this codebase using 5 subagents in parallel. Each should explore a
different top-level directory (frontend-huggingface, mcp-sse-proxy, docling_mcp, frontend-huggingface/src/lib/server/textGeneration) and also explore these files (STATUS.md, docker-compose.yml, .env, frontend-huggingface/src/lib/server/textGeneration/mcp/runMcpFlow.ts) and
report back what they find.
