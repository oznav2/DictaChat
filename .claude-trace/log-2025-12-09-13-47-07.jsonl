The key is systematic verification, external memory storage, and healthy skepticism about our own assumptions.\n\n\nContents of /home/ilan/BricksLLM/CLAUDE.md (project instructions, checked into the codebase):\n\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to CLAUDE (claude.ai) when working with code in this repository.\n\n## Project Overview\n\n**BricksLLM** is a specialized, cloud-native AI gateway optimized for the local deployment and management of the **DictaLM-3.0** model. This project provides a complete, containerized infrastructure that orchestrates:\n\n-   **DictaLM-3.0 Inference**: Runs the `dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf` model via a dedicated `llama-server` container (Dockerized Llama.cpp with CUDA support).\n-   **AI Gateway**: A Go-based proxy that manages rate limiting, cost control, caching, and API key authentication between clients and the model.\n-   **Frontend Demo**: A lightweight, hot-reloading chat interface for interacting with DictaLM, demonstrating reasoning capabilities (`<think>` tags) and tool use.\n-   **Data Persistence**: PostgreSQL and Redis containers for storing configuration, logs, and cache data.\n\nThis setup is specifically designed for local usage, leveraging Docker Compose to spin up the entire stack with a single command. It acts as a production-ready template for deploying DictaLM with enterprise-grade management features.\n\n## Server Management Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Stop Before Start\nTo ensure a clean state and prevent \"Address already in use\" errors (especially with port bindings like 8003 or 5002), strict server management discipline is enforced.\n\n**Protocol:**\nBefore executing the `start.sh` script or any command that starts server services (like `docker compose up`), you **MUST ALWAYS** first stop any running server instances.\n\n**Required Workflow:**\n1.  Execute `./stop.sh` to tear down existing containers and networks.\n2.  Execute `./start.sh` to initialize the stack.\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\n./stop.sh  # Cleans up old containers and releases ports\n./start.sh # Starts the fresh stack\n```\n\n**Rationale:**\nThis prevents port binding conflicts and ensures that configuration changes (like volume bindings, environment variables, or hot-reload settings) are correctly applied to recreated containers.\n\n## Technical Stack & Operations Guide\n\n### 1. Stack Deployment Process\n\nThe deployment is orchestrated by the `start.sh` script, which ensures a consistent and error-free initialization of the environment using Docker Compose.\n\n**Deployment Sequence:**\n1.  **Prerequisite Validation**: Checks for Docker, NVIDIA drivers (for GPU support), and essential configuration files (`.env`, `docker-compose.yml`).\n2.  **Resource Check**: Verifies available GPU resources and disk space to ensure the model can be loaded.\n3.  **Configuration Validation**: Ensures all required environment variables are set in `.env`.\n4.  **Service Initialization**:\n    -   Executes `docker compose up -d` to start the backend services (`postgresql`, `redis`, `llama-server`, `bricksllm`, `swagger-ui`).\n    -   Starts the frontend container (`frontend`).\n5.  **Health Verification**:\n    -   Polls the health endpoints of each service (`pg_isready`, `redis-cli ping`, `curl health`).\n    -   **Critical Step**: Waits for `llama-server` to fully load the DictaLM model into memory (indicated by a healthy HTTP 200 response).\n6.  **Integration Testing**: Runs a suite of internal tests (`test-stack.sh`) to verify connectivity between the proxy, the model, and the database.\n7.  **Access Information**: Prints the available URLs for all services.\n\n### 2. Container Configuration\n\nThe stack runs on a custom Docker bridge network (`bricksllm-network`), enabling secure internal communication.\n\n| Service | Container Name | Host Port | Internal Port | Purpose |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Frontend** | `bricksllm-frontend` | `8003` | `8003` | User Chat Interface (Hot-reload enabled in dev) |\n| **BricksLLM Admin** | `bricksllm-gateway` | `8001` | `8001` | Management API (Keys, Providers, Settings) |\n| **BricksLLM Proxy** | `bricksllm-gateway` | `8002` | `8002` | AI Gateway Proxy (Rate limiting, Logging) |\n| **Llama Server** | `bricksllm-llama` | `5002` | `5002` | DictaLM Inference Engine (CUDA accelerated) |\n| **PostgreSQL** | `bricksllm-postgresql`| `5433` | `5432` | Primary Database |\n| **Redis** | `bricksllm-redis` | `6380` | `6379` | High-speed Cache & Rate Limiter |\n| **Swagger UI** | `bricksllm-swagger` | `8082` | `8080` | API Documentation Viewer |\n\n### 3. Service Endpoints\n\n#### Frontend UI\n-   **URL**: `http://localhost:8003`\n-   **Access**: Browser-based chat interface.\n\n#### BricksLLM Proxy API\nThe primary entry point for AI applications.\n-   **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8002`\n-   **Auth**: Bearer Token (API Key required)\n-   **Key Endpoint**: \n    -   `POST /api/custom/providers/llama-cpp-root/chat/completions`\n    -   **Payload**: OpenAI-compatible JSON (messages, model, tools).\n    -   **Response**: Streaming or JSON completion with `<think>` tags.\n\n#### BricksLLM Admin API\nUsed for configuration and management.\n-   **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8001`\n-   **Auth**: None (Local default) / Configurable\n-   **Key Endpoints**:\n    -   `GET /api/health`: System health status.\n    -   `PUT /api/key-management/keys`: Create/Update API keys.\n    -   `PUT /api/provider-settings`: Configure LLM providers.\n    -   `GET /api/events`: Retrieve usage logs and analytics.\n\n#### Llama Server (Direct)\nDirect access to the model (bypassing the gateway).\n-   **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5002`\n-   **Endpoint**: `POST /v1/chat/completions`\n-   **Auth**: Bearer token (optional/ignored by default server config, but header may be required).\n\n### 4. Model Loading Process\n\n**Mechanism**:\nUpon container start, the `llama-server` maps the GGUF model file from the host filesystem to the container and begins loading it into GPU VRAM (and system RAM if VRAM is insufficient).\n\n**Timing & Readiness**:\n-   **Duration**: Typically **10-45 seconds**, depending on disk speed (NVMe recommended) and model size (24B parameters).\n-   **Readiness Check**: The container will report as \"healthy\" only when the model is fully loaded and the HTTP server is accepting requests.\n\n> **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:**\n> **DO NOT** attempt to interact with the frontend or API endpoints until the `start.sh` script explicitly reports that all services are **HEALTHY**.\n> Premature interaction while the model is loading will result in `Connection Refused` or `502 Bad Gateway` errors and may require a stack restart.\n\n### 5. Operational Considerations\n\n**System Requirements**:\n-   **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with **16GB+ VRAM** (24GB recommended for full offload of the 24B parameter model).\n-   **RAM**: 32GB+ System RAM (if partial CPU offloading is required).\n-   **Disk**: Fast NVMe SSD (critical for model loading times).\n\n**Performance**:\n-   **Inference**: The system uses `llama.cpp` with CUDA acceleration. Performance scales with the number of GPU layers offloaded (`--n-gpu-layers`).\n-   **Context Window**: Default configured to 8192 tokens. Increasing this will significantly increase VRAM usage.\n\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Two-Server Design\nThe application runs two HTTP servers simultaneously:\n- **Admin Server** (port 8001): Management API for keys, provider settings, routes, policies, events, and reporting\n- **Proxy Server** (port 8002): Handles actual LLM API requests, enforces rate/cost limits, and proxies to providers\n\nBoth servers are started from `cmd/bricksllm/main.go` and run concurrently.\n\n### Core Components\n\n**Manager Layer** (`internal/manager/`)\n- Coordinates between storage, caches, and business logic\n- `Manager`: Key management with validation and cache invalidation\n- `ReportingManager`: Analytics and event aggregation  \n- `ProviderSettingsManager`: Provider configuration with optional encryption\n- `RouteManager`: Custom routing with failover/retry logic\n- `PolicyManager`: Access control policies\n- `UserManager`: Per-user rate/cost limits\n\n**Provider Implementations** (`internal/provider/`)\n- Each provider has its own package: `openai/`, `anthropic/`, `azure/`, `vllm/`, `deepinfra/`, `custom/`\n- Token counting and cost estimation are provider-specific\n- Providers use shared `Setting` struct for configuration\n\n**Storage Layer** (`internal/storage/`)\n- `postgresql/`: Primary persistent storage (keys, settings, events, users, policies, routes)\n- `redis/`: Multiple Redis databases (0-10) for different caches (rate limits, cost limits, API cache, access cache, provider settings cache, keys cache)\n- `memdb/`: In-memory caches that poll PostgreSQL at configurable intervals (`IN_MEMORY_DB_UPDATE_INTERVAL`, default 5s) for custom providers and routes\n\n**Routing & Failover** (`internal/route/`)\n- `Route` struct defines multi-step execution with provider failover\n- Each `Step` can specify retries, timeout, model override, and request parameter overrides\n- Supports exponential or constant backoff strategies\n- Routes are stored in PostgreSQL and cached in memdb\n\n**Event System** (`internal/message/`, `internal/event/`)\n- Message bus pattern with pub/sub for async event processing\n- `Consumer` runs multiple goroutines (default 3, configurable via `NUMBER_OF_EVENT_MESSAGE_CONSUMERS`) to handle events\n- Events track request/response data, latency, cost, and tokens for analytics\n\n**Additional Features**\n- `internal/authenticator/`: Key validation and provider setting lookup\n- `internal/validator/`: Rate limit and cost limit enforcement\n- `internal/recorder/`: Records usage metrics to Redis and PostgreSQL\n- `internal/pii/`: PII detection using AWS Comprehend\n- `internal/policy/`: Custom policies for content filtering (uses OpenAI for detection)\n- `internal/encryptor/`: Optional encryption for sensitive settings\n\n### Database Schema\nTables are created/migrated on startup in `cmd/bricksllm/main.go`:\n- `keys`: API keys with rate/cost limits, tags, allowed paths/models\n- `provider_settings`: Provider API keys and configuration\n- `custom_providers`: Custom provider endpoints\n- `routes`: Multi-step routing configurations\n- `events`: Individual API request logs\n- `events_by_day`: Aggregated daily metrics (with unique index on keyId/day/provider/model)\n- `policies`: Access control rules\n- `users`: User-level rate/cost limits\n\n## Environment Variables Configuration\n\nThis section comprehensively documents the environment variables used to configure the BricksLLM stack. These variables are primarily defined in the `.env` file and consumed by Docker Compose to orchestrate the services.\n\n### 1. Variable Reference Table\n\n| Variable Name | Default Value | Required | Purpose | Used In |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **PostgreSQL** | | | | |\n| `POSTGRESQL_USERNAME` | `postgres` | Yes | Database user for BricksLLM metadata. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` | `postgres` | Yes | Database password. **Security Warning: Change in production.** | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `POSTGRESQL_DB` | `bricksllm` | Yes | Name of the database to create/use. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `POSTGRESQL_HOST_PORT` | `5433` | Yes | Host port mapping for PostgreSQL. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| **Redis** | | | | |\n| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | (Complex String) | Yes | Password for Redis authentication. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `REDIS_HOST_PORT` | `6380` | Yes | Host port mapping for Redis. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| **Llama Server** | | | | |\n| `LLAMA_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda` | Yes | Docker image for the inference engine. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `LLAMA_HOST_PORT` | `5002` | Yes | Host port for direct model access. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `HF_FILE` | `dictalm...gguf` | Yes | Filename of the GGUF model to load. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `LOCAL_MODEL_PATH` | `./models` | Yes | Host path containing the model file. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `CONTEXT_SIZE` | `8192` | No | Context window size in tokens. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `N_GPU_LAYERS` | `99` | No | Number of layers to offload to GPU. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `SYSTEM_PROMPT` | \"You are DictaLM...\" | No | Base system instruction injected into the chat template. | `.env`, `llama_entrypoint.sh` |\n| **BricksLLM Gateway** | | | | |\n| `BRICKSLLM_MODE` | `production` | Yes | Operational mode (`development` or `production`). | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `BRICKSLLM_ADMIN_PORT`| `8001` | Yes | Host port for the Admin API. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `BRICKSLLM_PROXY_PORT`| `8002` | Yes | Host port for the Proxy API. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `IN_MEMORY_DB_UPDATE_INTERVAL` | `5s` | No | Sync frequency between Redis/MemDB and Postgres. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n\n### 2. Configuration Logic & Flow\n\n#### Loading Hierarchy\n1.  **`.env` File**: The primary source of truth. Docker Compose automatically reads this file to populate variable substitutions (e.g., `${VARIABLE}`).\n2.  **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines how these variables are passed to containers.\n    *   **Direct Mapping**: `ports: - '${LLAMA_HOST_PORT:-5002}:5002'` (Uses default if env var is missing).\n    *   **Environment Section**: `environment: SYSTEM_PROMPT: ${SYSTEM_PROMPT}` (Passes value into container).\n3.  **Application Code**:\n    *   **BricksLLM (Go)**: Uses `internal/config` to load variables via the `koanf` library.\n    *   **Llama Server (Bash)**: Uses `llama_entrypoint.sh` to read `$SYSTEM_PROMPT` and inject it into the Jinja template.\n\n#### Frontend Inheritance\nThe Frontend container (`bricksllm-frontend`) does **not** directly inherit variables from `.env`. Instead, it relies on:\n-   **Hardcoded API Configuration**: `index.js` points to `http://localhost:8002`.\n-   **Docker Network**: Resolves internal hostnames (`bricksllm-gateway`, `llama-server`) via the bridge network.\n-   **`NODE_ENV`**: Passed explicitly in `docker-compose.yml` to control hot-reloading.\n\n#### Security Considerations\n-   **Secrets**: `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` and `REDIS_PASSWORD` are visible in `.env`. For production, use Docker Swarm Secrets or a vault.\n-   **Git**: Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore` (use `.env.template` for version control).\n\n### 3. Code References\n\n**Go Configuration Loading (`internal/config/config.go`):**\n```go\ntype Config struct {\n    PostgresqlUsername string `koanf:\"postgresql_username\" env:\"POSTGRESQL_USERNAME\"`\n    PostgresqlPassword string `koanf:\"postgresql_password\" env:\"POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD\"`\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**System Prompt Injection (`llama_entrypoint.sh`):**\n```bash\n# Default if unset\nif [ -z \"$SYSTEM_PROMPT\" ]; then\n    export SYSTEM_PROMPT=\"You are a helpful assistant.\"\nfi\n\n# Template substitution\nESCAPED_PROMPT=${SYSTEM_PROMPT//\\\"/\\\\\\\"}\nFINAL_TEMPLATE=\"${TEMPLATE/__SYSTEM_PROMPT__/$ESCAPED_PROMPT}\"\n```\n\n### 4. Operational Details\n\n#### Overriding Variables\n-   **Temporary Override**: `SYSTEM_PROMPT=\"New Prompt\" ./start.sh` (Shell environment takes precedence).\n-   **Permanent Change**: Edit `.env` and run `./stop.sh && ./start.sh`.\n\n#### Common Scenarios\n1.  **Changing Model**:\n    *   Update `LOCAL_MODEL_PATH` to the new folder.\n    *   Update `HF_FILE` to the new filename.\n    *   Restart stack.\n2.  **Increasing Context Window**:\n    *   Set `CONTEXT_SIZE=16384` in `.env`.\n    *   **Warning**: Increases VRAM usage. Verify GPU capacity first.\n3.  **Debug Mode**:\n    *   Set `BRICKSLLM_MODE=development` in `.env`.\n    *   Enables verbose logging in the Go application.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n-   **Issue**: \"Variable not set\" error during startup.\n    *   **Fix**: Ensure you copied `.env.template` to `.env` and filled in all required fields.\n-   **Issue**: Changes in `.env` not reflecting.\n    *   **Fix**: You MUST run `./stop.sh` before `./start.sh`. Docker Compose often caches configuration if containers are just restarted.\n-   **Issue**: \"Password authentication failed\".\n    *   **Fix**: Mismatch between `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` in `.env` and the existing database volume. Run `docker volume rm bricksllm_postgresql_data` to reset the DB with the new password.\n\n## Production Deployment (Docker Compose)\n\n\n### Overview\n\nThe production Docker Compose setup provides a resource-efficient AI gateway stack with:\n\n- **Llama.cpp Server**: OpenAI-compatible inference server using GGUF models (CPU/GPU hybrid)\n- **BricksLLM**: AI gateway with rate limiting, cost tracking, and analytics\n- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for BricksLLM metadata\n- **Redis**: Caching layer for response caching and rate limiting\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Docker** 24.0+ with Compose V2\n- **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support (Recommended for speed)\n- **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** installed\n- **Local GGUF Model**: A quantized model file (e.g., `dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf`)\n\n### Quick Start\n\n1.  **Copy and configure the environment file**:\n    ```bash\n    cp .env.template .env\n    ```\n\n2.  **Edit `.env` with your settings**:\n    ```bash\n    # Llama.cpp Configuration\n    LLAMA_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda\n    LLAMA_HOST_PORT=5002\n    \n    # Model Configuration\n    HF_REPO=VRDate/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking-FP8-Q4_K_M-GGUF\n    HF_FILE=dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf\n    \n    # Local Model Path (Windows/WSL example)\n    LOCAL_MODEL_PATH=/mnt/c/Users/username/.lmstudio/models/...\n    \n    # Context Window\n    CONTEXT_SIZE=2048\n    ```\n\n3.  **Start the complete stack**:\n    ```bash\n    ./start.sh\n    ```\n\n    This script will:\n    -   Verify prerequisites and model existence\n    -   Start services (Llama.cpp, BricksLLM, Postgres, Redis)\n    -   Run health checks\n    -   Provide access URLs\n\n4.  **Verify the deployment**:\n    ```bash\n    ./test-stack.sh\n    ```\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     Docker Bridge Network                    │\n│                     (bricksllm-network)                      │\n│                                                               │\n│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐  │\n│  │  PostgreSQL  │    │    Redis     │    │  Llama.cpp   │  │\n│  │   (5433)     │◄───┤   (6380)     │◄───┤   (5002)     │  │\n│  │              │    │              │    │   + GPU      │  │\n│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘  │\n│         ▲                    ▲                    ▲         │\n│         │                    │                    │         │\n│         └────────────────────┼────────────────────┘         │\n│                              │                              │\n│                    ┌──────────────────┐                     │\n│                    │   BricksLLM      │                     │\n│                    │                  │                     │\n│                    │  Admin:   8001   │◄─── Management     │\n│                    │  Proxy:   8002   │◄─── Inference      │\n│                    └──────────────────┘                     │\n│                                                               │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Service Ports\n\n| Service       | Internal Port | Host Port | Purpose                          |\n|---------------|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------|\n| BricksLLM     | 8001          | 8001      | Admin API (provider settings)    |\n| BricksLLM     | 8002          | 8002      | Proxy API (inference requests)   |\n| Llama.cpp     | 5002          | 5002      | OpenAI-compatible inference API  |\n| Swagger UI    | 8080          | 8081      | API Documentation                |\n| Admin Panel   | 3000          | 3000      | Web UI for Management            |\n| PostgreSQL    | 5432          | 5433      | Database                         |\n| Redis         | 6379          | 6380      | Cache and rate limiting          |\n\n### Direct Model Access & Configuration\n\nThis section describes how to interact directly with the Llama.cpp inference server (port 5002) or via the BricksLLM proxy (port 8002).\n\n#### Authentication\n- **Llama.cpp (Direct)**: Supports `Authorization: Bearer <any-string>` (e.g., `sk-no-key-required`). The key itself is not validated by the server but the header is often required by clients.\n- **BricksLLM (Proxy)**: Requires a valid BricksLLM API key in the `Authorization: Bearer <your-key>` header.\n\n#### API Endpoint\n- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions` (Direct) or `http://localhost:8002/api/providers/openai/v1/chat/completions` (Proxy)\n\n#### Payload Configuration\nThe server accepts OpenAI-compatible chat completion payloads.\n\n**Required Fields:**\n- `model`: Model identifier (e.g., `dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf` or just `default`).\n- `messages`: Array of message objects with `role` and `content`.\n\n**Optional Fields:**\n- `stream`: Boolean (true/false) for streaming responses.\n- `temperature`: Controls randomness (0.0 to 2.0).\n- `max_tokens`: Limit generation length.\n\n#### Example Request\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer sk-no-key-required\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"default\",\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"Hello! Who are you?\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"stream\": false\n  }'\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nSending request to http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions...\n\n--- Model Response ---\n{\"id\":\"chatcmpl-...\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"created\":1715612345,\"model\":\"default\",\"choices\":[{\"index\":0,\"message\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"Hello! I am an AI assistant...\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":10,\"completion_tokens\":20,\"total_tokens\":30}}\n```\n\n### Client Usage (Go Example)\n\nA reference Go client is provided in `client/main.go` to demonstrate how to programmatically interact with the model.\n\n#### Overview\n- **File**: `client/main.go`\n- **Purpose**: Demonstrates a strongly-typed Go client for OpenAI-compatible chat completions.\n- **Dependencies**: Standard library only (`net/http`, `encoding/json`).\n\n#### Key Components\n1. **Structs**: `ChatRequest` and `ChatResponse` map to standard OpenAI JSON schemas.\n2. **Configuration**: \n   - URL: `http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions`\n   - Timeout: 120 seconds (to accommodate model loading/reasoning time).\n3. **Execution**:\n   ```bash\n   cd client\n   go run main.go\n   ```\n\n#### Code Snippet\n```go\n// Example request payload structure\ntype ChatRequest struct {\n    Model    string    `json:\"model\"`\n    Messages []Message `json:\"messages\"`\n    Stream   bool      `json:\"stream\"`\n}\n\n// ... inside main() ...\nreqBody := ChatRequest{\n    Model: \"default\",\n    Messages: []Message{\n        {Role: \"user\", Content: \"Hello!

This is useful for running custom models like DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking or any other model supported by vLLM.\n\n### Current Configuration\n\n**Provider Setting:**\n- **Provider**: vLLM\n- **URL**: `http://localhost:8000/v1`\n- **API Key**: `sk-no-key-required`\n- **Setting ID**: `0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a`\n\n**Bricks API Key:**\n- **Name**: DictaLM vLLM Key\n- **Key**: `dicta-vllm-key`\n- **Tags**: `[\"dicta\", \"vllm\"]`\n- **Rate Limit**: 100 requests/minute\n- **Cost Limit**: $10.00 USD\n- **Key ID**: `a70de8e0-f84d-44e4-b7d4-d80e0e1942bd`\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n#### 1. Start vLLM Server\nFirst, start your vLLM server with the DictaLM model:\n```bash\nvllm serve dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking \\\n  --enable-auto-tool-choice \\\n  --tool-call-parser hermes \\\n  --reasoning_parser deepseek_r1\n```\n\nThe vLLM server will run on `http://localhost:8000` by default.\n\n#### 2. Create Provider Setting\nCreate a provider setting that points to your vLLM server:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/provider-settings \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"provider\":\"vllm\",\n          \"setting\": {\n             \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/v1\",\n             \"apikey\": \"sk-no-key-required\"\n          }\n      }'\n```\n\nCopy the `id` from the response (e.g., `0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a`).\n\n**Note**: The URL should not have a trailing `/`.\n\n#### 3. Create Bricks API Key\nCreate an API key with rate limiting and cost controls:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/key-management/keys \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n\t      \"name\": \"DictaLM vLLM Key\",\n\t      \"key\": \"dicta-vllm-key\",\n\t      \"tags\": [\"dicta\", \"vllm\"],\n        \"settingIds\": [\"0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a\"],\n        \"rateLimitOverTime\": 100,\n        \"rateLimitUnit\": \"m\",\n        \"costLimitInUsd\": 10.0\n      }'\n```\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n#### Using cURL\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/providers/vllm/v1/chat/completions \\\n   -H \"Authorization: Bearer dicta-vllm-key\" \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"model\": \"dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking\",\n          \"messages\": [\n              {\n                  \"role\": \"user\",\n                  \"content\": \"Hello, how are you?\"\n              }\n          ]\n      }'\n```\n\n#### Using Python OpenAI SDK\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI(\n\tbase_url='http://localhost:8002/api/providers/vllm/v1',\n\tapi_key='dicta-vllm-key'\n)\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n\tmodel='dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking',\n\tmessages=[\n\t\t{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello, how are you?'}\n\t],\n)\n\nprint(response.choices[0].message.content)\n```\n\n#### Using JavaScript/TypeScript\n```javascript\nimport OpenAI from 'openai'\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n\tapiKey: 'dicta-vllm-key',\n\tbaseURL: 'http://localhost:8002/api/providers/vllm/v1',\n})\n\nconst response = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n\tmodel: 'dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking',\n\tmessages: [\n\t\t{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello, how are you?' }\n\t],\n})\n\nconsole.log(response.choices[0].message.content)\n```\n\n### Features Provided by BricksLLM\n\nWhen using BricksLLM as a proxy for your vLLM server, you get:\n\n1. **Rate Limiting**: Control requests per minute (100 req/min in current setup)\n2. **Cost Tracking**: Monitor and limit spending (up to $10 USD in current setup)\n3. **Request/Response Logging**: Track all API calls for analytics\n4. **API Key Management**: Secure access with custom API keys\n5. **Multi-Provider Support**: Easily switch between different vLLM deployments or other providers\n6. **Analytics & Reporting**: View usage metrics via admin API\n7. **Caching**: Optional response caching for identical requests\n8. **Failover & Retries**: Configure automatic retry logic and fallback providers\n\n### Monitoring & Management\n\n#### View Provider Settings\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8001/api/provider-settings\n```\n\n#### View API Keys\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8001/api/key-management/keys\n```\n\n#### View Events/Logs\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v2/events \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"tags\": [\"dicta\"]\n      }'\n```\n\n#### Update Rate Limits\n```bash\ncurl -X PATCH http://localhost:8001/api/key-management/keys/a70de8e0-f84d-44e4-b7d4-d80e0e1942bd \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"rateLimitOverTime\": 200,\n          \"rateLimitUnit\": \"m\"\n      }'\n```\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\n#### Multiple vLLM Instances\nYou can create multiple provider settings for different vLLM deployments:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/provider-settings \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"provider\":\"vllm\",\n          \"setting\": {\n             \"url\": \"http://localhost:8001/v1\",\n             \"apikey\": \"another-key\"\n          },\n          \"name\": \"vLLM Instance 2\"\n      }'\n```\n\n#### Model Restrictions\nRestrict which models can be accessed with a specific key:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/key-management/keys \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n\t      \"name\": \"Restricted Key\",\n\t      \"key\": \"restricted-vllm-key\",\n\t      \"tags\": [\"restricted\"],\n        \"settingIds\": [\"0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a\"],\n        \"allowedModels\": [\"dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking\"],\n        \"rateLimitOverTime\": 50,\n        \"rateLimitUnit\": \"m\"\n      }'\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### Connection Refused Error\nIf you get a \"Connection refused\" error when testing:\n1.

This mechanism is critical for enabling the model's reasoning capabilities (`<think>`) and tool-use functionalities.\n\n### Template Architecture (`chat_template.jinja2`)\n\nThe chat template defines the exact text format the model sees during inference. It transforms a list of abstract messages (System, User, Assistant, Tool) into a single prompt string that the model completes.\n\n#### 1. System Prompt Injection\nThe template logic prioritizes a dynamic system prompt but allows for a fallback injection via environment variables.\n\n**Logic Flow:**\n1.  **Check for User-Provided System Message:**\n    - If the first message in the conversation array (`messages[0]`) has the role `\"system\"`, its content is used as the `custom_instructions`.\n2.  **Fallback to Environment Variable:**\n    - If no system message is provided in the API call, the template inserts a placeholder: `__SYSTEM_PROMPT__`.\n    - **Injection Mechanism:** During container startup (`llama_entrypoint.sh`), this placeholder is replaced by the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` environment variable defined in your `.env` file.\n    - **Default Value:** If `SYSTEM_PROMPT` is unset, it defaults to `\"You are a helpful assistant.\"`.\n\n**Code Reference (`chat_template.jinja2.template`):**\n```jinja\n{#  ───── header (system message) ─────  #} \n{{- \"<|im_start|>system\\n\" -}} \n{%- if messages[0].role == \"system\" -%} \n    {%- set custom_instructions = messages[0].content.rstrip() -%} \n{%- endif -%} \n{%- if custom_instructions -%} \n    {{- custom_instructions -}} \n{%- else -%} \n    {{- \"__SYSTEM_PROMPT__\" -}} \n{%- endif -%}\n```\n\n#### 2. Tool Definition & Schema\nIf tools are provided in the API request, the template appends a structured XML definition to the system prompt. This teaches the model how to call functions.\n\n**Format:**\n```xml\n## Tools\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\nYou are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:\n<tools>\n{ \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"description\": \"...\", \"parameters\": { ... } }\n</tools>\nFor each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": <function-name>, \"arguments\": <args-json-object>}\n</tool_call>\n```\n\n#### 3. Message Formatting (ChatML)\nThe template uses the ChatML format (`<|im_start|>role\\ncontent<|im_end|>`) to structure the conversation history.\n\n-   **User Messages:** `<|im_start|>user\\nUser query...<|im_end|>`\n-   **Assistant Messages:** `<|im_start|>assistant\\nResponse...<|im_end|>`\n-   **Tool Outputs:** `<|im_start|>tool\\n<tool_response>\\nResult...\\n</tool_response><|im_end|>`\n\n#### 4. Reasoning & Thinking (`<think>`)\nThe template is designed to handle \"Chain of Thought\" reasoning. The model is instructed (via the system prompt) to wrap its internal reasoning process in `<think>` tags.\n\n**Assistant Generation Logic:**\n-   The template attempts to separate `reasoning_content` from the final response.\n-   If the model outputs `<think>...</think>`, the template preserves this structure so clients (like the frontend) can parse and visualize the reasoning separately from the final answer.\n\n**Code Reference (`chat_template.jinja2.template`):**\n```jinja\n{%- if \"</think>\" in content -%} \n    {%- set reasoning_content = content.split(\"</think>\")[0].rstrip(\"\\n\").split(\"<think>\")[-1].lstrip(\"\\n\") -%} \n    {%- set content = content.split(\"</think>\")[-1].lstrip(\"\\n\") -%} \n{%- endif -%}\n{{- \"\\n<|im_start|>\" + message.role + \"\\n<think>\" + reasoning_content.strip(\"\\n\") + \"</think>\" + content.lstrip(\"\\n\") -}} \n```\n\n### User-Assistant Interaction Mechanism\n\n#### 1. Request Flow\n1.  **Frontend/Client**: Sends a standard OpenAI-compatible JSON payload (messages, tools, etc.) to BricksLLM (`port 8002`).\n2.  **BricksLLM Proxy**: Forward the request to the `llama-server` (`port 5002`).\n3.  **Llama Server**:\n    -   Loads the `chat_template.jinja2` file.\n    -   Processes the `messages` array through the template.\n    -   Replaces `__SYSTEM_PROMPT__` with the injected value if no system message exists.\n    -   Generates a single raw string prompt.\n    -   Feeds this prompt to the DictaLM model.\n\n#### 2. Response Construction\n1.  **Thinking Phase**: The model generates a `<think>` block containing its reasoning steps.\n2.  **Tool Call Phase (Optional)**: If a tool is needed, the model outputs a `<tool_call>` XML block instead of text.\n3.  **Final Answer Phase**: After reasoning (and potential tool execution), the model generates the final response text.\n4.  **Client Parsing**: The frontend detects these tags to render the UI components (Reasoning bubble, Tool invocation, Final answer).\n\n### Environment Variable Injection (`.env`)\n\nThe system relies on the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` variable to define the model's base personality and capabilities.\n\n-   **File**: `.env`\n-   **Variable**: `SYSTEM_PROMPT`\n-   **Injection Point**: `llama_entrypoint.sh`\n-   **Usage**:\n    -   At container startup, `llama_entrypoint.sh` reads `chat_template.jinja2.template`.\n    -   It replaces the literal string `__SYSTEM_PROMPT__` with the value of `$SYSTEM_PROMPT`.\n    -   The result is saved as `chat_template.jinja2`, which `llama-server` uses for every request.\n\n**Example `.env` Configuration:**\n```bash\nSYSTEM_PROMPT=\"You are DictaLM, a helpful AI assistant. When answering, you MUST first provide your internal reasoning or thought process wrapped in <think> tags, followed by your final response to the user outside the tags.\"\n```\n\n## Frontend Documentation\n\n\n### Overview\nThe BricksLLM frontend is a lightweight, single-page application (SPA) designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the BricksLLM gateway and the underlying DictaLM model. It provides a chat interface that supports reasoning visualization (via `<think>` tags) and integrates directly with the BricksLLM proxy.\n\n### Architecture\n\n#### Core Components\n- **HTML (`index.html`)**: Defines the structure of the chat interface, including the sidebar, chat panel, and input area. It loads the `index.js` script with a version query parameter for cache busting.\n- **CSS (`style.css`)**: Handles styling, implementing a dark-themed, professional UI with responsive design elements.\n- **JavaScript (`index.js`)**: Contains the application logic, including message rendering, API interaction, and response parsing.\n- **Docker**: The frontend is containerized using `node:18-alpine` and served via `http-server`.\n\n#### Message Rendering Logic\nThe frontend uses a custom rendering function `appendMessage` to display chat bubbles. It supports:\n- **Reasoning Separation**: Detects `<think>` tags in the assistant's response and renders the reasoning content separately from the final answer.\n- **System Context Stripping**: Uses regex (`leakagePattern`) to remove any leaked system context from the model's output (e.g., \"The user says... The system context...\").\n- **Typing Indicators**: Displays a typing animation while waiting for the model's response.\n- **Role-Based Styling**: Differentiates between user and assistant messages visually.\n\n### API Integration\n\n#### Configuration\nThe frontend uses the following hardcoded configuration to connect to the BricksLLM proxy. These settings match the custom provider and key configured in the backend.\n\n**Provider Setting (Custom):**\n- **Provider Name**: `llama-cpp-root`\n- **URL**: `http://llama-server:5002`\n- **Setting ID**: (Auto-generated by setup script)\n\n**API Key:**\n- **Key**: `sk-bricksllm-frontend-llama-key-explicit`\n- **Name**: `Frontend Llama Key`\n- **Allowed Path**: `/chat/completions`\n\n#### Endpoint\nThe frontend communicates with the BricksLLM proxy via the following endpoint:\n- **URL**: `http://localhost:8002/api/custom/providers/llama-cpp-root/chat/completions`\n- **Method**: `POST`\n- **Headers**:\n  - `Authorization`: `Bearer sk-bricksllm-frontend-llama-key-explicit` (Key configured for the custom provider)\n  - `Content-Type`: `application/json`\n\n#### Payload\nThe frontend sends a standard OpenAI-compatible chat completion payload:\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are DictaLM, a helpful AI assistant. When answering, you MUST first provide your internal reasoning or thought process wrapped in <think> tags...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"User input here\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Deployment\n\n#### Docker Configuration\nThe frontend is defined as a service in `docker-compose.yml`:\n- **Image**: `node:18-alpine`\n- **Container Name**: `bricksllm-frontend`\n- **Port Mapping**: Host port `8003` -> Container port `8003`\n- **Volume**: Binds the local `frontend` directory to `/app` in the container for hot-reloading.\n\n#### Development Mode (Hot Reload)\n- **Command**: The container runs a shell command that checks `NODE_ENV`.\n  - If `development`: Runs `bun run build` (updates cache version) and starts `http-server` with caching disabled (`-c-1`).\n  - If `production`: Starts `http-server` with default caching.\n- **Environment Variable**: `NODE_ENV=development` is set in `docker-compose.yml` to enable hot-reloading behavior.\n\n#### Cache Management\n- **Automatic Versioning**: The `npm run build` script automatically updates the `index.js` version query parameter in `index.html` using a timestamp (`v=$(date +%s)`).\n- **No-Cache Server**: In development, `http-server` is run with `-c-1` to prevent browser caching of static assets.\n\n### Key Code Snippets\n\n#### Response Parsing (`index.js`)\n```javascript\n// Check for <think> tags\nconst thinkMatch = reply.match(/<think>([\\s\\S]*?)<\\/think>/);\nif (thinkMatch) {\n    const thinkContent = thinkMatch[1].trim();\n    // Render thinking content...\n}\n\n// Clean up potential system context leakage\nconst leakagePattern = /The user says \".*?\"\\. The system context: .*?\\. So respond with .*?\\./s;\ncontent = content.replace(leakagePattern, '').trim();\n```\n\n#### Build Script (`package.json`)\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"bun x http-server -p 8003 -c-1\",\n  \"build\": \"sed -i \\\"s/index.js?v=[^\\\"]*/index.js?v=$(date +%s)/\\\" index.html\"\n}\n```\n\n\n      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks.

This project provides a complete, containerized infrastructure that orchestrates:\n\n-   **DictaLM-3.0 Inference**: Runs the `dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf` model via a dedicated `llama-server` container (Dockerized Llama.cpp with CUDA support).\n-   **AI Gateway**: A Go-based proxy that manages rate limiting, cost control, caching, and API key authentication between clients and the model.\n-   **Frontend Demo**: A lightweight, hot-reloading chat interface for interacting with DictaLM, demonstrating reasoning capabilities (`<think>` tags) and tool use.\n-   **Data Persistence**: PostgreSQL and Redis containers for storing configuration, logs, and cache data.\n\nThis setup is specifically designed for local usage, leveraging Docker Compose to spin up the entire stack with a single command. It acts as a production-ready template for deploying DictaLM with enterprise-grade management features.\n\n## Server Management Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Stop Before Start\nTo ensure a clean state and prevent \"Address already in use\" errors (especially with port bindings like 8003 or 5002), strict server management discipline is enforced.\n\n**Protocol:**\nBefore executing the `start.sh` script or any command that starts server services (like `docker compose up`), you **MUST ALWAYS** first stop any running server instances.\n\n**Required Workflow:**\n1.  Execute `./stop.sh` to tear down existing containers and networks.\n2.  Execute `./start.sh` to initialize the stack.\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\n./stop.sh  # Cleans up old containers and releases ports\n./start.sh # Starts the fresh stack\n```\n\n**Rationale:**\nThis prevents port binding conflicts and ensures that configuration changes (like volume bindings, environment variables, or hot-reload settings) are correctly applied to recreated containers.\n\n## Technical Stack & Operations Guide\n\n### 1. Stack Deployment Process\n\nThe deployment is orchestrated by the `start.sh` script, which ensures a consistent and error-free initialization of the environment using Docker Compose.\n\n**Deployment Sequence:**\n1.  **Prerequisite Validation**: Checks for Docker, NVIDIA drivers (for GPU support), and essential configuration files (`.env`, `docker-compose.yml`).\n2.  **Resource Check**: Verifies available GPU resources and disk space to ensure the model can be loaded.\n3.  **Configuration Validation**: Ensures all required environment variables are set in `.env`.\n4.  **Service Initialization**:\n    -   Executes `docker compose up -d` to start the backend services (`postgresql`, `redis`, `llama-server`, `bricksllm`, `swagger-ui`).\n    -   Starts the frontend container (`frontend`).\n5.  **Health Verification**:\n    -   Polls the health endpoints of each service (`pg_isready`, `redis-cli ping`, `curl health`).\n    -   **Critical Step**: Waits for `llama-server` to fully load the DictaLM model into memory (indicated by a healthy HTTP 200 response).\n6.  **Integration Testing**: Runs a suite of internal tests (`test-stack.sh`) to verify connectivity between the proxy, the model, and the database.\n7.  **Access Information**: Prints the available URLs for all services.\n\n### 2. Container Configuration\n\nThe stack runs on a custom Docker bridge network (`bricksllm-network`), enabling secure internal communication.\n\n| Service | Container Name | Host Port | Internal Port | Purpose |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Frontend** | `bricksllm-frontend` | `8003` | `8003` | User Chat Interface (Hot-reload enabled in dev) |\n| **BricksLLM Admin** | `bricksllm-gateway` | `8001` | `8001` | Management API (Keys, Providers, Settings) |\n| **BricksLLM Proxy** | `bricksllm-gateway` | `8002` | `8002` | AI Gateway Proxy (Rate limiting, Logging) |\n| **Llama Server** | `bricksllm-llama` | `5002` | `5002` | DictaLM Inference Engine (CUDA accelerated) |\n| **PostgreSQL** | `bricksllm-postgresql`| `5433` | `5432` | Primary Database |\n| **Redis** | `bricksllm-redis` | `6380` | `6379` | High-speed Cache & Rate Limiter |\n| **Swagger UI** | `bricksllm-swagger` | `8082` | `8080` | API Documentation Viewer |\n\n### 3. Service Endpoints\n\n#### Frontend UI\n-   **URL**: `http://localhost:8003`\n-   **Access**: Browser-based chat interface.\n\n#### BricksLLM Proxy API\nThe primary entry point for AI applications.\n-   **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8002`\n-   **Auth**: Bearer Token (API Key required)\n-   **Key Endpoint**: \n    -   `POST /api/custom/providers/llama-cpp-root/chat/completions`\n    -   **Payload**: OpenAI-compatible JSON (messages, model, tools).\n    -   **Response**: Streaming or JSON completion with `<think>` tags.\n\n#### BricksLLM Admin API\nUsed for configuration and management.\n-   **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8001`\n-   **Auth**: None (Local default) / Configurable\n-   **Key Endpoints**:\n    -   `GET /api/health`: System health status.\n    -   `PUT /api/key-management/keys`: Create/Update API keys.\n    -   `PUT /api/provider-settings`: Configure LLM providers.\n    -   `GET /api/events`: Retrieve usage logs and analytics.\n\n#### Llama Server (Direct)\nDirect access to the model (bypassing the gateway).\n-   **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5002`\n-   **Endpoint**: `POST /v1/chat/completions`\n-   **Auth**: Bearer token (optional/ignored by default server config, but header may be required).\n\n### 4. Model Loading Process\n\n**Mechanism**:\nUpon container start, the `llama-server` maps the GGUF model file from the host filesystem to the container and begins loading it into GPU VRAM (and system RAM if VRAM is insufficient).\n\n**Timing & Readiness**:\n-   **Duration**: Typically **10-45 seconds**, depending on disk speed (NVMe recommended) and model size (24B parameters).\n-   **Readiness Check**: The container will report as \"healthy\" only when the model is fully loaded and the HTTP server is accepting requests.\n\n> **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:**\n> **DO NOT** attempt to interact with the frontend or API endpoints until the `start.sh` script explicitly reports that all services are **HEALTHY**.\n> Premature interaction while the model is loading will result in `Connection Refused` or `502 Bad Gateway` errors and may require a stack restart.\n\n### 5. Operational Considerations\n\n**System Requirements**:\n-   **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with **16GB+ VRAM** (24GB recommended for full offload of the 24B parameter model).\n-   **RAM**: 32GB+ System RAM (if partial CPU offloading is required).\n-   **Disk**: Fast NVMe SSD (critical for model loading times).\n\n**Performance**:\n-   **Inference**: The system uses `llama.cpp` with CUDA acceleration. Performance scales with the number of GPU layers offloaded (`--n-gpu-layers`).\n-   **Context Window**: Default configured to 8192 tokens. Increasing this will significantly increase VRAM usage.\n\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Two-Server Design\nThe application runs two HTTP servers simultaneously:\n- **Admin Server** (port 8001): Management API for keys, provider settings, routes, policies, events, and reporting\n- **Proxy Server** (port 8002): Handles actual LLM API requests, enforces rate/cost limits, and proxies to providers\n\nBoth servers are started from `cmd/bricksllm/main.go` and run concurrently.\n\n### Core Components\n\n**Manager Layer** (`internal/manager/`)\n- Coordinates between storage, caches, and business logic\n- `Manager`: Key management with validation and cache invalidation\n- `ReportingManager`: Analytics and event aggregation  \n- `ProviderSettingsManager`: Provider configuration with optional encryption\n- `RouteManager`: Custom routing with failover/retry logic\n- `PolicyManager`: Access control policies\n- `UserManager`: Per-user rate/cost limits\n\n**Provider Implementations** (`internal/provider/`)\n- Each provider has its own package: `openai/`, `anthropic/`, `azure/`, `vllm/`, `deepinfra/`, `custom/`\n- Token counting and cost estimation are provider-specific\n- Providers use shared `Setting` struct for configuration\n\n**Storage Layer** (`internal/storage/`)\n- `postgresql/`: Primary persistent storage (keys, settings, events, users, policies, routes)\n- `redis/`: Multiple Redis databases (0-10) for different caches (rate limits, cost limits, API cache, access cache, provider settings cache, keys cache)\n- `memdb/`: In-memory caches that poll PostgreSQL at configurable intervals (`IN_MEMORY_DB_UPDATE_INTERVAL`, default 5s) for custom providers and routes\n\n**Routing & Failover** (`internal/route/`)\n- `Route` struct defines multi-step execution with provider failover\n- Each `Step` can specify retries, timeout, model override, and request parameter overrides\n- Supports exponential or constant backoff strategies\n- Routes are stored in PostgreSQL and cached in memdb\n\n**Event System** (`internal/message/`, `internal/event/`)\n- Message bus pattern with pub/sub for async event processing\n- `Consumer` runs multiple goroutines (default 3, configurable via `NUMBER_OF_EVENT_MESSAGE_CONSUMERS`) to handle events\n- Events track request/response data, latency, cost, and tokens for analytics\n\n**Additional Features**\n- `internal/authenticator/`: Key validation and provider setting lookup\n- `internal/validator/`: Rate limit and cost limit enforcement\n- `internal/recorder/`: Records usage metrics to Redis and PostgreSQL\n- `internal/pii/`: PII detection using AWS Comprehend\n- `internal/policy/`: Custom policies for content filtering (uses OpenAI for detection)\n- `internal/encryptor/`: Optional encryption for sensitive settings\n\n### Database Schema\nTables are created/migrated on startup in `cmd/bricksllm/main.go`:\n- `keys`: API keys with rate/cost limits, tags, allowed paths/models\n- `provider_settings`: Provider API keys and configuration\n- `custom_providers`: Custom provider endpoints\n- `routes`: Multi-step routing configurations\n- `events`: Individual API request logs\n- `events_by_day`: Aggregated daily metrics (with unique index on keyId/day/provider/model)\n- `policies`: Access control rules\n- `users`: User-level rate/cost limits\n\n## Environment Variables Configuration\n\nThis section comprehensively documents the environment variables used to configure the BricksLLM stack. These variables are primarily defined in the `.env` file and consumed by Docker Compose to orchestrate the services.\n\n### 1. Variable Reference Table\n\n| Variable Name | Default Value | Required | Purpose | Used In |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **PostgreSQL** | | | | |\n| `POSTGRESQL_USERNAME` | `postgres` | Yes | Database user for BricksLLM metadata. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` | `postgres` | Yes | Database password. **Security Warning: Change in production.** | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `POSTGRESQL_DB` | `bricksllm` | Yes | Name of the database to create/use. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `POSTGRESQL_HOST_PORT` | `5433` | Yes | Host port mapping for PostgreSQL. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| **Redis** | | | | |\n| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | (Complex String) | Yes | Password for Redis authentication. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `REDIS_HOST_PORT` | `6380` | Yes | Host port mapping for Redis. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| **Llama Server** | | | | |\n| `LLAMA_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda` | Yes | Docker image for the inference engine. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `LLAMA_HOST_PORT` | `5002` | Yes | Host port for direct model access. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `HF_FILE` | `dictalm...gguf` | Yes | Filename of the GGUF model to load. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `LOCAL_MODEL_PATH` | `./models` | Yes | Host path containing the model file. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `CONTEXT_SIZE` | `8192` | No | Context window size in tokens. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `N_GPU_LAYERS` | `99` | No | Number of layers to offload to GPU. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `SYSTEM_PROMPT` | \"You are DictaLM...\" | No | Base system instruction injected into the chat template. | `.env`, `llama_entrypoint.sh` |\n| **BricksLLM Gateway** | | | | |\n| `BRICKSLLM_MODE` | `production` | Yes | Operational mode (`development` or `production`). | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `BRICKSLLM_ADMIN_PORT`| `8001` | Yes | Host port for the Admin API. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `BRICKSLLM_PROXY_PORT`| `8002` | Yes | Host port for the Proxy API. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `IN_MEMORY_DB_UPDATE_INTERVAL` | `5s` | No | Sync frequency between Redis/MemDB and Postgres. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n\n### 2. Configuration Logic & Flow\n\n#### Loading Hierarchy\n1.  **`.env` File**: The primary source of truth. Docker Compose automatically reads this file to populate variable substitutions (e.g., `${VARIABLE}`).\n2.  **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines how these variables are passed to containers.\n    *   **Direct Mapping**: `ports: - '${LLAMA_HOST_PORT:-5002}:5002'` (Uses default if env var is missing).\n    *   **Environment Section**: `environment: SYSTEM_PROMPT: ${SYSTEM_PROMPT}` (Passes value into container).\n3.  **Application Code**:\n    *   **BricksLLM (Go)**: Uses `internal/config` to load variables via the `koanf` library.\n    *   **Llama Server (Bash)**: Uses `llama_entrypoint.sh` to read `$SYSTEM_PROMPT` and inject it into the Jinja template.\n\n#### Frontend Inheritance\nThe Frontend container (`bricksllm-frontend`) does **not** directly inherit variables from `.env`. Instead, it relies on:\n-   **Hardcoded API Configuration**: `index.js` points to `http://localhost:8002`.\n-   **Docker Network**: Resolves internal hostnames (`bricksllm-gateway`, `llama-server`) via the bridge network.\n-   **`NODE_ENV`**: Passed explicitly in `docker-compose.yml` to control hot-reloading.\n\n#### Security Considerations\n-   **Secrets**: `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` and `REDIS_PASSWORD` are visible in `.env`. For production, use Docker Swarm Secrets or a vault.\n-   **Git**: Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore` (use `.env.template` for version control).\n\n### 3. Code References\n\n**Go Configuration Loading (`internal/config/config.go`):**\n```go\ntype Config struct {\n    PostgresqlUsername string `koanf:\"postgresql_username\" env:\"POSTGRESQL_USERNAME\"`\n    PostgresqlPassword string `koanf:\"postgresql_password\" env:\"POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD\"`\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**System Prompt Injection (`llama_entrypoint.sh`):**\n```bash\n# Default if unset\nif [ -z \"$SYSTEM_PROMPT\" ]; then\n    export SYSTEM_PROMPT=\"You are a helpful assistant.\"\nfi\n\n# Template substitution\nESCAPED_PROMPT=${SYSTEM_PROMPT//\\\"/\\\\\\\"}\nFINAL_TEMPLATE=\"${TEMPLATE/__SYSTEM_PROMPT__/$ESCAPED_PROMPT}\"\n```\n\n### 4. Operational Details\n\n#### Overriding Variables\n-   **Temporary Override**: `SYSTEM_PROMPT=\"New Prompt\" ./start.sh` (Shell environment takes precedence).\n-   **Permanent Change**: Edit `.env` and run `./stop.sh && ./start.sh`.\n\n#### Common Scenarios\n1.  **Changing Model**:\n    *   Update `LOCAL_MODEL_PATH` to the new folder.\n    *   Update `HF_FILE` to the new filename.\n    *   Restart stack.\n2.  **Increasing Context Window**:\n    *   Set `CONTEXT_SIZE=16384` in `.env`.\n    *   **Warning**: Increases VRAM usage. Verify GPU capacity first.\n3.  **Debug Mode**:\n    *   Set `BRICKSLLM_MODE=development` in `.env`.\n    *   Enables verbose logging in the Go application.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n-   **Issue**: \"Variable not set\" error during startup.\n    *   **Fix**: Ensure you copied `.env.template` to `.env` and filled in all required fields.\n-   **Issue**: Changes in `.env` not reflecting.\n    *   **Fix**: You MUST run `./stop.sh` before `./start.sh`. Docker Compose often caches configuration if containers are just restarted.\n-   **Issue**: \"Password authentication failed\".\n    *   **Fix**: Mismatch between `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` in `.env` and the existing database volume. Run `docker volume rm bricksllm_postgresql_data` to reset the DB with the new password.\n\n## Production Deployment (Docker Compose)\n\n\n### Overview\n\nThe production Docker Compose setup provides a resource-efficient AI gateway stack with:\n\n- **Llama.cpp Server**: OpenAI-compatible inference server using GGUF models (CPU/GPU hybrid)\n- **BricksLLM**: AI gateway with rate limiting, cost tracking, and analytics\n- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for BricksLLM metadata\n- **Redis**: Caching layer for response caching and rate limiting\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Docker** 24.0+ with Compose V2\n- **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support (Recommended for speed)\n- **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** installed\n- **Local GGUF Model**: A quantized model file (e.g., `dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf`)\n\n### Quick Start\n\n1.  **Copy and configure the environment file**:\n    ```bash\n    cp .env.template .env\n    ```\n\n2.  **Edit `.env` with your settings**:\n    ```bash\n    # Llama.cpp Configuration\n    LLAMA_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda\n    LLAMA_HOST_PORT=5002\n    \n    # Model Configuration\n    HF_REPO=VRDate/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking-FP8-Q4_K_M-GGUF\n    HF_FILE=dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf\n    \n    # Local Model Path (Windows/WSL example)\n    LOCAL_MODEL_PATH=/mnt/c/Users/username/.lmstudio/models/...\n    \n    # Context Window\n    CONTEXT_SIZE=2048\n    ```\n\n3.  **Start the complete stack**:\n    ```bash\n    ./start.sh\n    ```\n\n    This script will:\n    -   Verify prerequisites and model existence\n    -   Start services (Llama.cpp, BricksLLM, Postgres, Redis)\n    -   Run health checks\n    -   Provide access URLs\n\n4.  **Verify the deployment**:\n    ```bash\n    ./test-stack.sh\n    ```\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     Docker Bridge Network                    │\n│                     (bricksllm-network)                      │\n│                                                               │\n│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐  │\n│  │  PostgreSQL  │    │    Redis     │    │  Llama.cpp   │  │\n│  │   (5433)     │◄───┤   (6380)     │◄───┤   (5002)     │  │\n│  │              │    │              │    │   + GPU      │  │\n│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘  │\n│         ▲                    ▲                    ▲         │\n│         │                    │                    │         │\n│         └────────────────────┼────────────────────┘         │\n│                              │                              │\n│                    ┌──────────────────┐                     │\n│                    │   BricksLLM      │                     │\n│                    │                  │                     │\n│                    │  Admin:   8001   │◄─── Management     │\n│                    │  Proxy:   8002   │◄─── Inference      │\n│                    └──────────────────┘                     │\n│                                                               │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Service Ports\n\n| Service       | Internal Port | Host Port | Purpose                          |\n|---------------|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------|\n| BricksLLM     | 8001          | 8001      | Admin API (provider settings)    |\n| BricksLLM     | 8002          | 8002      | Proxy API (inference requests)   |\n| Llama.cpp     | 5002          | 5002      | OpenAI-compatible inference API  |\n| Swagger UI    | 8080          | 8081      | API Documentation                |\n| Admin Panel   | 3000          | 3000      | Web UI for Management            |\n| PostgreSQL    | 5432          | 5433      | Database                         |\n| Redis         | 6379          | 6380      | Cache and rate limiting          |\n\n### Direct Model Access & Configuration\n\nThis section describes how to interact directly with the Llama.cpp inference server (port 5002) or via the BricksLLM proxy (port 8002).\n\n#### Authentication\n- **Llama.cpp (Direct)**: Supports `Authorization: Bearer <any-string>` (e.g., `sk-no-key-required`). The key itself is not validated by the server but the header is often required by clients.\n- **BricksLLM (Proxy)**: Requires a valid BricksLLM API key in the `Authorization: Bearer <your-key>` header.\n\n#### API Endpoint\n- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions` (Direct) or `http://localhost:8002/api/providers/openai/v1/chat/completions` (Proxy)\n\n#### Payload Configuration\nThe server accepts OpenAI-compatible chat completion payloads.\n\n**Required Fields:**\n- `model`: Model identifier (e.g., `dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf` or just `default`).\n- `messages`: Array of message objects with `role` and `content`.\n\n**Optional Fields:**\n- `stream`: Boolean (true/false) for streaming responses.\n- `temperature`: Controls randomness (0.0 to 2.0).\n- `max_tokens`: Limit generation length.\n\n#### Example Request\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer sk-no-key-required\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"default\",\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"Hello! Who are you?\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"stream\": false\n  }'\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nSending request to http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions...\n\n--- Model Response ---\n{\"id\":\"chatcmpl-...\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"created\":1715612345,\"model\":\"default\",\"choices\":[{\"index\":0,\"message\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"Hello! I am an AI assistant...\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":10,\"completion_tokens\":20,\"total_tokens\":30}}\n```\n\n### Client Usage (Go Example)\n\nA reference Go client is provided in `client/main.go` to demonstrate how to programmatically interact with the model.\n\n#### Overview\n- **File**: `client/main.go`\n- **Purpose**: Demonstrates a strongly-typed Go client for OpenAI-compatible chat completions.\n- **Dependencies**: Standard library only (`net/http`, `encoding/json`).\n\n#### Key Components\n1. **Structs**: `ChatRequest` and `ChatResponse` map to standard OpenAI JSON schemas.\n2. **Configuration**: \n   - URL: `http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions`\n   - Timeout: 120 seconds (to accommodate model loading/reasoning time).\n3. **Execution**:\n   ```bash\n   cd client\n   go run main.go\n   ```\n\n#### Code Snippet\n```go\n// Example request payload structure\ntype ChatRequest struct {\n    Model    string    `json:\"model\"`\n    Messages []Message `json:\"messages\"`\n    Stream   bool      `json:\"stream\"`\n}\n\n// ... inside main() ...\nreqBody := ChatRequest{\n    Model: \"default\",\n    Messages: []Message{\n        {Role: \"user\", Content: \"Hello! Who are you?\"},\n    },\n    Stream: false,\n}\n```\n\n### Management Commands\n\n#### Start the Stack\n```bash\n./start.sh\n```\n\n#### Stop the Stack\n```bash\n./stop.sh\n```\n\n#### View Logs\n```bash\ndocker compose logs -f llama-server\ndocker compose logs -f bricksllm\n```\n\n#### Check Status\n```bash\ndocker compose ps\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nFor comprehensive troubleshooting, see [DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md](DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md).\n\n**Model Not Found**:\nEnsure `LOCAL_MODEL_PATH` in `.env` points to the directory containing `HF_FILE`.\n\n**GPU Not Used**:\nCheck `docker compose logs llama-server` for `CUDA` backend loading. Ensure `N_GPU_LAYERS` is set high (e.g., 99).\n\n\n---\n\n## Development (Local Mode)\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Go 1.23 or higher\n- PostgreSQL\n- Redis\n\n### Building\n```bash\n# Build the main binary\ngo build -o bricksllm ./cmd/bricksllm\n\n# Build with specific flags (used by goreleaser)\nCGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o bricksllm ./cmd/bricksllm\n```\n\n### Running Locally\n\n**Start dependencies (PostgreSQL + Redis):**\n```bash\ndocker compose up\n```\n\n**Run the application:**\n```bash\n# Development mode with detailed logging\ngo run ./cmd/bricksllm -m=dev\n\n# Production mode (less verbose logging)\ngo run ./cmd/bricksllm -m=production\n\n# With privacy mode (controls request/response logging)\ngo run ./cmd/bricksllm -m=dev -p=strict\n```\n\nThe application requires PostgreSQL and Redis to be running. Default connection settings:\n- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5433` (user: `postgres`, password: `postgres`)\n- Redis: `localhost:6380` (password: `eYVX7EwVmmxKPCDmwMtyKVge8oLd2t81`)\n\n**Start with custom database ports:**\n```bash\nPOSTGRESQL_HOSTS=localhost POSTGRESQL_PORT=5433 POSTGRESQL_USERNAME=postgres POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=postgres REDIS_HOSTS=localhost REDIS_PORT=6380 REDIS_PASSWORD=eYVX7EwVmmxKPCDmwMtyKVge8oLd2t81 go run ./cmd/bricksllm -m=dev\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nTests are integration tests located in `internal/testing/`:\n```bash\n# Run all integration tests\ngo test ./internal/testing/...\n\n# Run specific test\ngo test ./internal/testing -run TestApiKey_Creation\n\n# Run with verbose output\ngo test -v ./internal/testing/...\n```\n\nIntegration tests require the admin server to be running on `localhost:8001` and proxy server on `localhost:8002`.\n\n### Docker\n\n**Build Docker image:**\n```bash\n# Development\ndocker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t bricksllm:dev .\n\n# Production\ndocker build -f Dockerfile.prod -t bricksllm:latest .\n```\n\n**Pull latest:**\n```bash\ndocker pull luyuanxin1995/bricksllm:latest\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\nKey environment variables (see `internal/config/config.go` for full list):\n- `POSTGRESQL_HOSTS`, `POSTGRESQL_USERNAME`, `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRESQL_DB_NAME`\n- `REDIS_HOSTS`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`\n- `IN_MEMORY_DB_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: How often memdb syncs with PostgreSQL (default: 5s)\n- `PROXY_TIMEOUT`: Timeout for proxy requests (default: 600s)\n- `NUMBER_OF_EVENT_MESSAGE_CONSUMERS`: Event processing workers (default: 3)\n- `ADMIN_PASS`: Optional password for admin API\n- `ENABLE_ENCRYPTION`: Enable encryption for provider settings\n- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for custom policy detection\n- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Required for PII detection\n\nConfiguration can also be loaded from:\n- Environment variables\n- `.env` file in working directory\n- JSON config file specified by `CONFIG_FILE_NAME` env var\n\n## Common Workflows\n\n### Adding a New Provider\n1. Create package in `internal/provider/<provider_name>/`\n2. Implement token counter and cost estimator\n3. Add provider case to proxy server routing logic\n4. Update `provider.Setting` validation if needed\n\n### Modifying Key Validation\n- Key validation logic is in `internal/key/key.go` (`Validate()` method)\n- Manager-level validation in `internal/manager/key.go` (`CreateKey()` and `UpdateKey()`)\n- Runtime validation in `internal/validator/validator.go`\n\n### Adding New API Endpoints\n- Admin endpoints: Add handler in `internal/server/web/admin/` and register route in `admin.go`\n- Proxy endpoints: Add handler in `internal/server/web/proxy/` and register route in the proxy server setup\n\n### Debugging Event Processing\n- Events are processed asynchronously by consumers\n- Check `internal/message/consumer.go` for consumer logic\n- Handler logic is in `internal/message/handler.go`\n- Metrics are sent to Datadog/StatsD if configured (`STATS_PROVIDER`)\n\n## Project Structure Notes\n- Command-line entry point is in `cmd/bricksllm/main.go`\n- All business logic is in `internal/` packages\n- Server implementations use Gin web framework\n- Logging uses Uber's Zap library\n- Database migrations run automatically on startup\n- Multiple Redis databases (0-10) are used for different cache types to avoid key collisions\n\n## Codebase Structure and Technical Architecture\n\nThis section provides a comprehensive breakdown of the project's organization, technical stack, and component relationships, designed to help developers navigate and modify the system effectively.\n\n### 1.

This is useful for running custom models like DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking or any other model supported by vLLM.\n\n### Current Configuration\n\n**Provider Setting:**\n- **Provider**: vLLM\n- **URL**: `http://localhost:8000/v1`\n- **API Key**: `sk-no-key-required`\n- **Setting ID**: `0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a`\n\n**Bricks API Key:**\n- **Name**: DictaLM vLLM Key\n- **Key**: `dicta-vllm-key`\n- **Tags**: `[\"dicta\", \"vllm\"]`\n- **Rate Limit**: 100 requests/minute\n- **Cost Limit**: $10.00 USD\n- **Key ID**: `a70de8e0-f84d-44e4-b7d4-d80e0e1942bd`\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n#### 1. Start vLLM Server\nFirst, start your vLLM server with the DictaLM model:\n```bash\nvllm serve dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking \\\n  --enable-auto-tool-choice \\\n  --tool-call-parser hermes \\\n  --reasoning_parser deepseek_r1\n```\n\nThe vLLM server will run on `http://localhost:8000` by default.\n\n#### 2. Create Provider Setting\nCreate a provider setting that points to your vLLM server:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/provider-settings \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"provider\":\"vllm\",\n          \"setting\": {\n             \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/v1\",\n             \"apikey\": \"sk-no-key-required\"\n          }\n      }'\n```\n\nCopy the `id` from the response (e.g., `0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a`).\n\n**Note**: The URL should not have a trailing `/`.\n\n#### 3.

This mechanism is critical for enabling the model's reasoning capabilities (`<think>`) and tool-use functionalities.\n\n### Template Architecture (`chat_template.jinja2`)\n\nThe chat template defines the exact text format the model sees during inference. It transforms a list of abstract messages (System, User, Assistant, Tool) into a single prompt string that the model completes.\n\n#### 1. System Prompt Injection\nThe template logic prioritizes a dynamic system prompt but allows for a fallback injection via environment variables.\n\n**Logic Flow:**\n1.  **Check for User-Provided System Message:**\n    - If the first message in the conversation array (`messages[0]`) has the role `\"system\"`, its content is used as the `custom_instructions`.\n2.  **Fallback to Environment Variable:**\n    - If no system message is provided in the API call, the template inserts a placeholder: `__SYSTEM_PROMPT__`.\n    - **Injection Mechanism:** During container startup (`llama_entrypoint.sh`), this placeholder is replaced by the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` environment variable defined in your `.env` file.\n    - **Default Value:** If `SYSTEM_PROMPT` is unset, it defaults to `\"You are a helpful assistant.\"`.\n\n**Code Reference (`chat_template.jinja2.template`):**\n```jinja\n{#  ───── header (system message) ─────  #} \n{{- \"<|im_start|>system\\n\" -}} \n{%- if messages[0].role == \"system\" -%} \n    {%- set custom_instructions = messages[0].content.rstrip() -%} \n{%- endif -%} \n{%- if custom_instructions -%} \n    {{- custom_instructions -}} \n{%- else -%} \n    {{- \"__SYSTEM_PROMPT__\" -}} \n{%- endif -%}\n```\n\n#### 2. Tool Definition & Schema\nIf tools are provided in the API request, the template appends a structured XML definition to the system prompt. This teaches the model how to call functions.\n\n**Format:**\n```xml\n## Tools\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\nYou are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:\n<tools>\n{ \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"description\": \"...\", \"parameters\": { ... } }\n</tools>\nFor each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": <function-name>, \"arguments\": <args-json-object>}\n</tool_call>\n```\n\n#### 3. Message Formatting (ChatML)\nThe template uses the ChatML format (`<|im_start|>role\\ncontent<|im_end|>`) to structure the conversation history.\n\n-   **User Messages:** `<|im_start|>user\\nUser query...<|im_end|>`\n-   **Assistant Messages:** `<|im_start|>assistant\\nResponse...<|im_end|>`\n-   **Tool Outputs:** `<|im_start|>tool\\n<tool_response>\\nResult...\\n</tool_response><|im_end|>`\n\n#### 4. Reasoning & Thinking (`<think>`)\nThe template is designed to handle \"Chain of Thought\" reasoning. The model is instructed (via the system prompt) to wrap its internal reasoning process in `<think>` tags.\n\n**Assistant Generation Logic:**\n-   The template attempts to separate `reasoning_content` from the final response.\n-   If the model outputs `<think>...</think>`, the template preserves this structure so clients (like the frontend) can parse and visualize the reasoning separately from the final answer.\n\n**Code Reference (`chat_template.jinja2.template`):**\n```jinja\n{%- if \"</think>\" in content -%} \n    {%- set reasoning_content = content.split(\"</think>\")[0].rstrip(\"\\n\").split(\"<think>\")[-1].lstrip(\"\\n\") -%} \n    {%- set content = content.split(\"</think>\")[-1].lstrip(\"\\n\") -%} \n{%- endif -%}\n{{- \"\\n<|im_start|>\" + message.role + \"\\n<think>\" + reasoning_content.strip(\"\\n\") + \"</think>\" + content.lstrip(\"\\n\") -}} \n```\n\n### User-Assistant Interaction Mechanism\n\n#### 1. Request Flow\n1.  **Frontend/Client**: Sends a standard OpenAI-compatible JSON payload (messages, tools, etc.) to BricksLLM (`port 8002`).\n2.  **BricksLLM Proxy**: Forward the request to the `llama-server` (`port 5002`).\n3.  **Llama Server**:\n    -   Loads the `chat_template.jinja2` file.\n    -   Processes the `messages` array through the template.\n    -   Replaces `__SYSTEM_PROMPT__` with the injected value if no system message exists.\n    -   Generates a single raw string prompt.\n    -   Feeds this prompt to the DictaLM model.\n\n#### 2. Response Construction\n1.  **Thinking Phase**: The model generates a `<think>` block containing its reasoning steps.\n2.  **Tool Call Phase (Optional)**: If a tool is needed, the model outputs a `<tool_call>` XML block instead of text.\n3.  **Final Answer Phase**: After reasoning (and potential tool execution), the model generates the final response text.\n4.  **Client Parsing**: The frontend detects these tags to render the UI components (Reasoning bubble, Tool invocation, Final answer).\n\n### Environment Variable Injection (`.env`)\n\nThe system relies on the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` variable to define the model's base personality and capabilities.\n\n-   **File**: `.env`\n-   **Variable**: `SYSTEM_PROMPT`\n-   **Injection Point**: `llama_entrypoint.sh`\n-   **Usage**:\n    -   At container startup, `llama_entrypoint.sh` reads `chat_template.jinja2.template`.\n    -   It replaces the literal string `__SYSTEM_PROMPT__` with the value of `$SYSTEM_PROMPT`.\n    -   The result is saved as `chat_template.jinja2`, which `llama-server` uses for every request.\n\n**Example `.env` Configuration:**\n```bash\nSYSTEM_PROMPT=\"You are DictaLM, a helpful AI assistant. When answering, you MUST first provide your internal reasoning or thought process wrapped in <think> tags, followed by your final response to the user outside the tags.\"\n```\n\n## Frontend Documentation\n\n\n### Overview\nThe BricksLLM frontend is a lightweight, single-page application (SPA) designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the BricksLLM gateway and the underlying DictaLM model. It provides a chat interface that supports reasoning visualization (via `<think>` tags) and integrates directly with the BricksLLM proxy.\n\n### Architecture\n\n#### Core Components\n- **HTML (`index.html`)**: Defines the structure of the chat interface, including the sidebar, chat panel, and input area. It loads the `index.js` script with a version query parameter for cache busting.\n- **CSS (`style.css`)**: Handles styling, implementing a dark-themed, professional UI with responsive design elements.\n- **JavaScript (`index.js`)**: Contains the application logic, including message rendering, API interaction, and response parsing.\n- **Docker**: The frontend is containerized using `node:18-alpine` and served via `http-server`.\n\n#### Message Rendering Logic\nThe frontend uses a custom rendering function `appendMessage` to display chat bubbles. It supports:\n- **Reasoning Separation**: Detects `<think>` tags in the assistant's response and renders the reasoning content separately from the final answer.\n- **System Context Stripping**: Uses regex (`leakagePattern`) to remove any leaked system context from the model's output (e.g., \"The user says... The system context...\").\n- **Typing Indicators**: Displays a typing animation while waiting for the model's response.\n- **Role-Based Styling**: Differentiates between user and assistant messages visually.\n\n### API Integration\n\n#### Configuration\nThe frontend uses the following hardcoded configuration to connect to the BricksLLM proxy. These settings match the custom provider and key configured in the backend.\n\n**Provider Setting (Custom):**\n- **Provider Name**: `llama-cpp-root`\n- **URL**: `http://llama-server:5002`\n- **Setting ID**: (Auto-generated by setup script)\n\n**API Key:**\n- **Key**: `sk-bricksllm-frontend-llama-key-explicit`\n- **Name**: `Frontend Llama Key`\n- **Allowed Path**: `/chat/completions`\n\n#### Endpoint\nThe frontend communicates with the BricksLLM proxy via the following endpoint:\n- **URL**: `http://localhost:8002/api/custom/providers/llama-cpp-root/chat/completions`\n- **Method**: `POST`\n- **Headers**:\n  - `Authorization`: `Bearer sk-bricksllm-frontend-llama-key-explicit` (Key configured for the custom provider)\n  - `Content-Type`: `application/json`\n\n#### Payload\nThe frontend sends a standard OpenAI-compatible chat completion payload:\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are DictaLM, a helpful AI assistant. When answering, you MUST first provide your internal reasoning or thought process wrapped in <think> tags...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"User input here\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Deployment\n\n#### Docker Configuration\nThe frontend is defined as a service in `docker-compose.yml`:\n- **Image**: `node:18-alpine`\n- **Container Name**: `bricksllm-frontend`\n- **Port Mapping**: Host port `8003` -> Container port `8003`\n- **Volume**: Binds the local `frontend` directory to `/app` in the container for hot-reloading.\n\n#### Development Mode (Hot Reload)\n- **Command**: The container runs a shell command that checks `NODE_ENV`.\n  - If `development`: Runs `bun run build` (updates cache version) and starts `http-server` with caching disabled (`-c-1`).\n  - If `production`: Starts `http-server` with default caching.\n- **Environment Variable**: `NODE_ENV=development` is set in `docker-compose.yml` to enable hot-reloading behavior.\n\n#### Cache Management\n- **Automatic Versioning**: The `npm run build` script automatically updates the `index.js` version query parameter in `index.html` using a timestamp (`v=$(date +%s)`).\n- **No-Cache Server**: In development, `http-server` is run with `-c-1` to prevent browser caching of static assets.\n\n### Key Code Snippets\n\n#### Response Parsing (`index.js`)\n```javascript\n// Check for <think> tags\nconst thinkMatch = reply.match(/<think>([\\s\\S]*?)<\\/think>/);\nif (thinkMatch) {\n    const thinkContent = thinkMatch[1].trim();\n    // Render thinking content...\n}\n\n// Clean up potential system context leakage\nconst leakagePattern = /The user says \".*?\"\\. The system context: .*?\\. So respond with .*?\\./s;\ncontent = content.replace(leakagePattern, '').trim();\n```\n\n#### Build Script (`package.json`)\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"bun x http-server -p 8003 -c-1\",\n  \"build\": \"sed -i \\\"s/index.js?v=[^\\\"]*/index.js?v=$(date +%s)/\\\" index.html\"\n}\n```\n\n\n      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context unless it is highly relevant to your task.\n</system-reminder>\n"},{"type":"text","text":"Warmup","cache_control":{"type":"ephemeral"}}]}],"system":[{"type":"text","text":"You are Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude.","cache_control":{"type":"ephemeral"}},{"type":"text","text":"You are a file search specialist for Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude.

This project provides a complete, containerized infrastructure that orchestrates:\n\n-   **DictaLM-3.0 Inference**: Runs the `dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf` model via a dedicated `llama-server` container (Dockerized Llama.cpp with CUDA support).\n-   **AI Gateway**: A Go-based proxy that manages rate limiting, cost control, caching, and API key authentication between clients and the model.\n-   **Frontend Demo**: A lightweight, hot-reloading chat interface for interacting with DictaLM, demonstrating reasoning capabilities (`<think>` tags) and tool use.\n-   **Data Persistence**: PostgreSQL and Redis containers for storing configuration, logs, and cache data.\n\nThis setup is specifically designed for local usage, leveraging Docker Compose to spin up the entire stack with a single command. It acts as a production-ready template for deploying DictaLM with enterprise-grade management features.\n\n## Server Management Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Stop Before Start\nTo ensure a clean state and prevent \"Address already in use\" errors (especially with port bindings like 8003 or 5002), strict server management discipline is enforced.\n\n**Protocol:**\nBefore executing the `start.sh` script or any command that starts server services (like `docker compose up`), you **MUST ALWAYS** first stop any running server instances.\n\n**Required Workflow:**\n1.  Execute `./stop.sh` to tear down existing containers and networks.\n2.  Execute `./start.sh` to initialize the stack.\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\n./stop.sh  # Cleans up old containers and releases ports\n./start.sh # Starts the fresh stack\n```\n\n**Rationale:**\nThis prevents port binding conflicts and ensures that configuration changes (like volume bindings, environment variables, or hot-reload settings) are correctly applied to recreated containers.\n\n## Technical Stack & Operations Guide\n\n### 1. Stack Deployment Process\n\nThe deployment is orchestrated by the `start.sh` script, which ensures a consistent and error-free initialization of the environment using Docker Compose.\n\n**Deployment Sequence:**\n1.  **Prerequisite Validation**: Checks for Docker, NVIDIA drivers (for GPU support), and essential configuration files (`.env`, `docker-compose.yml`).\n2.  **Resource Check**: Verifies available GPU resources and disk space to ensure the model can be loaded.\n3.  **Configuration Validation**: Ensures all required environment variables are set in `.env`.\n4.  **Service Initialization**:\n    -   Executes `docker compose up -d` to start the backend services (`postgresql`, `redis`, `llama-server`, `bricksllm`, `swagger-ui`).\n    -   Starts the frontend container (`frontend`).\n5.  **Health Verification**:\n    -   Polls the health endpoints of each service (`pg_isready`, `redis-cli ping`, `curl health`).\n    -   **Critical Step**: Waits for `llama-server` to fully load the DictaLM model into memory (indicated by a healthy HTTP 200 response).\n6.  **Integration Testing**: Runs a suite of internal tests (`test-stack.sh`) to verify connectivity between the proxy, the model, and the database.\n7.  **Access Information**: Prints the available URLs for all services.\n\n### 2. Container Configuration\n\nThe stack runs on a custom Docker bridge network (`bricksllm-network`), enabling secure internal communication.\n\n| Service | Container Name | Host Port | Internal Port | Purpose |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Frontend** | `bricksllm-frontend` | `8003` | `8003` | User Chat Interface (Hot-reload enabled in dev) |\n| **BricksLLM Admin** | `bricksllm-gateway` | `8001` | `8001` | Management API (Keys, Providers, Settings) |\n| **BricksLLM Proxy** | `bricksllm-gateway` | `8002` | `8002` | AI Gateway Proxy (Rate limiting, Logging) |\n| **Llama Server** | `bricksllm-llama` | `5002` | `5002` | DictaLM Inference Engine (CUDA accelerated) |\n| **PostgreSQL** | `bricksllm-postgresql`| `5433` | `5432` | Primary Database |\n| **Redis** | `bricksllm-redis` | `6380` | `6379` | High-speed Cache & Rate Limiter |\n| **Swagger UI** | `bricksllm-swagger` | `8082` | `8080` | API Documentation Viewer |\n\n### 3. Service Endpoints\n\n#### Frontend UI\n-   **URL**: `http://localhost:8003`\n-   **Access**: Browser-based chat interface.\n\n#### BricksLLM Proxy API\nThe primary entry point for AI applications.\n-   **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8002`\n-   **Auth**: Bearer Token (API Key required)\n-   **Key Endpoint**: \n    -   `POST /api/custom/providers/llama-cpp-root/chat/completions`\n    -   **Payload**: OpenAI-compatible JSON (messages, model, tools).\n    -   **Response**: Streaming or JSON completion with `<think>` tags.\n\n#### BricksLLM Admin API\nUsed for configuration and management.\n-   **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8001`\n-   **Auth**: None (Local default) / Configurable\n-   **Key Endpoints**:\n    -   `GET /api/health`: System health status.\n    -   `PUT /api/key-management/keys`: Create/Update API keys.\n    -   `PUT /api/provider-settings`: Configure LLM providers.\n    -   `GET /api/events`: Retrieve usage logs and analytics.\n\n#### Llama Server (Direct)\nDirect access to the model (bypassing the gateway).\n-   **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5002`\n-   **Endpoint**: `POST /v1/chat/completions`\n-   **Auth**: Bearer token (optional/ignored by default server config, but header may be required).\n\n### 4. Model Loading Process\n\n**Mechanism**:\nUpon container start, the `llama-server` maps the GGUF model file from the host filesystem to the container and begins loading it into GPU VRAM (and system RAM if VRAM is insufficient).\n\n**Timing & Readiness**:\n-   **Duration**: Typically **10-45 seconds**, depending on disk speed (NVMe recommended) and model size (24B parameters).\n-   **Readiness Check**: The container will report as \"healthy\" only when the model is fully loaded and the HTTP server is accepting requests.\n\n> **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:**\n> **DO NOT** attempt to interact with the frontend or API endpoints until the `start.sh` script explicitly reports that all services are **HEALTHY**.\n> Premature interaction while the model is loading will result in `Connection Refused` or `502 Bad Gateway` errors and may require a stack restart.\n\n### 5. Operational Considerations\n\n**System Requirements**:\n-   **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with **16GB+ VRAM** (24GB recommended for full offload of the 24B parameter model).\n-   **RAM**: 32GB+ System RAM (if partial CPU offloading is required).\n-   **Disk**: Fast NVMe SSD (critical for model loading times).\n\n**Performance**:\n-   **Inference**: The system uses `llama.cpp` with CUDA acceleration. Performance scales with the number of GPU layers offloaded (`--n-gpu-layers`).\n-   **Context Window**: Default configured to 8192 tokens. Increasing this will significantly increase VRAM usage.\n\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Two-Server Design\nThe application runs two HTTP servers simultaneously:\n- **Admin Server** (port 8001): Management API for keys, provider settings, routes, policies, events, and reporting\n- **Proxy Server** (port 8002): Handles actual LLM API requests, enforces rate/cost limits, and proxies to providers\n\nBoth servers are started from `cmd/bricksllm/main.go` and run concurrently.\n\n### Core Components\n\n**Manager Layer** (`internal/manager/`)\n- Coordinates between storage, caches, and business logic\n- `Manager`: Key management with validation and cache invalidation\n- `ReportingManager`: Analytics and event aggregation  \n- `ProviderSettingsManager`: Provider configuration with optional encryption\n- `RouteManager`: Custom routing with failover/retry logic\n- `PolicyManager`: Access control policies\n- `UserManager`: Per-user rate/cost limits\n\n**Provider Implementations** (`internal/provider/`)\n- Each provider has its own package: `openai/`, `anthropic/`, `azure/`, `vllm/`, `deepinfra/`, `custom/`\n- Token counting and cost estimation are provider-specific\n- Providers use shared `Setting` struct for configuration\n\n**Storage Layer** (`internal/storage/`)\n- `postgresql/`: Primary persistent storage (keys, settings, events, users, policies, routes)\n- `redis/`: Multiple Redis databases (0-10) for different caches (rate limits, cost limits, API cache, access cache, provider settings cache, keys cache)\n- `memdb/`: In-memory caches that poll PostgreSQL at configurable intervals (`IN_MEMORY_DB_UPDATE_INTERVAL`, default 5s) for custom providers and routes\n\n**Routing & Failover** (`internal/route/`)\n- `Route` struct defines multi-step execution with provider failover\n- Each `Step` can specify retries, timeout, model override, and request parameter overrides\n- Supports exponential or constant backoff strategies\n- Routes are stored in PostgreSQL and cached in memdb\n\n**Event System** (`internal/message/`, `internal/event/`)\n- Message bus pattern with pub/sub for async event processing\n- `Consumer` runs multiple goroutines (default 3, configurable via `NUMBER_OF_EVENT_MESSAGE_CONSUMERS`) to handle events\n- Events track request/response data, latency, cost, and tokens for analytics\n\n**Additional Features**\n- `internal/authenticator/`: Key validation and provider setting lookup\n- `internal/validator/`: Rate limit and cost limit enforcement\n- `internal/recorder/`: Records usage metrics to Redis and PostgreSQL\n- `internal/pii/`: PII detection using AWS Comprehend\n- `internal/policy/`: Custom policies for content filtering (uses OpenAI for detection)\n- `internal/encryptor/`: Optional encryption for sensitive settings\n\n### Database Schema\nTables are created/migrated on startup in `cmd/bricksllm/main.go`:\n- `keys`: API keys with rate/cost limits, tags, allowed paths/models\n- `provider_settings`: Provider API keys and configuration\n- `custom_providers`: Custom provider endpoints\n- `routes`: Multi-step routing configurations\n- `events`: Individual API request logs\n- `events_by_day`: Aggregated daily metrics (with unique index on keyId/day/provider/model)\n- `policies`: Access control rules\n- `users`: User-level rate/cost limits\n\n## Environment Variables Configuration\n\nThis section comprehensively documents the environment variables used to configure the BricksLLM stack. These variables are primarily defined in the `.env` file and consumed by Docker Compose to orchestrate the services.\n\n### 1. Variable Reference Table\n\n| Variable Name | Default Value | Required | Purpose | Used In |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **PostgreSQL** | | | | |\n| `POSTGRESQL_USERNAME` | `postgres` | Yes | Database user for BricksLLM metadata. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` | `postgres` | Yes | Database password. **Security Warning: Change in production.** | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `POSTGRESQL_DB` | `bricksllm` | Yes | Name of the database to create/use. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `POSTGRESQL_HOST_PORT` | `5433` | Yes | Host port mapping for PostgreSQL. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| **Redis** | | | | |\n| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | (Complex String) | Yes | Password for Redis authentication. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `REDIS_HOST_PORT` | `6380` | Yes | Host port mapping for Redis. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| **Llama Server** | | | | |\n| `LLAMA_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda` | Yes | Docker image for the inference engine. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `LLAMA_HOST_PORT` | `5002` | Yes | Host port for direct model access. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `HF_FILE` | `dictalm...gguf` | Yes | Filename of the GGUF model to load. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `LOCAL_MODEL_PATH` | `./models` | Yes | Host path containing the model file. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `CONTEXT_SIZE` | `8192` | No | Context window size in tokens. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `N_GPU_LAYERS` | `99` | No | Number of layers to offload to GPU. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `SYSTEM_PROMPT` | \"You are DictaLM...\" | No | Base system instruction injected into the chat template. | `.env`, `llama_entrypoint.sh` |\n| **BricksLLM Gateway** | | | | |\n| `BRICKSLLM_MODE` | `production` | Yes | Operational mode (`development` or `production`). | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `BRICKSLLM_ADMIN_PORT`| `8001` | Yes | Host port for the Admin API. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `BRICKSLLM_PROXY_PORT`| `8002` | Yes | Host port for the Proxy API. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `IN_MEMORY_DB_UPDATE_INTERVAL` | `5s` | No | Sync frequency between Redis/MemDB and Postgres. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n\n### 2. Configuration Logic & Flow\n\n#### Loading Hierarchy\n1.  **`.env` File**: The primary source of truth. Docker Compose automatically reads this file to populate variable substitutions (e.g., `${VARIABLE}`).\n2.  **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines how these variables are passed to containers.\n    *   **Direct Mapping**: `ports: - '${LLAMA_HOST_PORT:-5002}:5002'` (Uses default if env var is missing).\n    *   **Environment Section**: `environment: SYSTEM_PROMPT: ${SYSTEM_PROMPT}` (Passes value into container).\n3.  **Application Code**:\n    *   **BricksLLM (Go)**: Uses `internal/config` to load variables via the `koanf` library.\n    *   **Llama Server (Bash)**: Uses `llama_entrypoint.sh` to read `$SYSTEM_PROMPT` and inject it into the Jinja template.\n\n#### Frontend Inheritance\nThe Frontend container (`bricksllm-frontend`) does **not** directly inherit variables from `.env`. Instead, it relies on:\n-   **Hardcoded API Configuration**: `index.js` points to `http://localhost:8002`.\n-   **Docker Network**: Resolves internal hostnames (`bricksllm-gateway`, `llama-server`) via the bridge network.\n-   **`NODE_ENV`**: Passed explicitly in `docker-compose.yml` to control hot-reloading.\n\n#### Security Considerations\n-   **Secrets**: `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` and `REDIS_PASSWORD` are visible in `.env`. For production, use Docker Swarm Secrets or a vault.\n-   **Git**: Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore` (use `.env.template` for version control).\n\n### 3. Code References\n\n**Go Configuration Loading (`internal/config/config.go`):**\n```go\ntype Config struct {\n    PostgresqlUsername string `koanf:\"postgresql_username\" env:\"POSTGRESQL_USERNAME\"`\n    PostgresqlPassword string `koanf:\"postgresql_password\" env:\"POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD\"`\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**System Prompt Injection (`llama_entrypoint.sh`):**\n```bash\n# Default if unset\nif [ -z \"$SYSTEM_PROMPT\" ]; then\n    export SYSTEM_PROMPT=\"You are a helpful assistant.\"\nfi\n\n# Template substitution\nESCAPED_PROMPT=${SYSTEM_PROMPT//\\\"/\\\\\\\"}\nFINAL_TEMPLATE=\"${TEMPLATE/__SYSTEM_PROMPT__/$ESCAPED_PROMPT}\"\n```\n\n### 4. Operational Details\n\n#### Overriding Variables\n-   **Temporary Override**: `SYSTEM_PROMPT=\"New Prompt\" ./start.sh` (Shell environment takes precedence).\n-   **Permanent Change**: Edit `.env` and run `./stop.sh && ./start.sh`.\n\n#### Common Scenarios\n1.  **Changing Model**:\n    *   Update `LOCAL_MODEL_PATH` to the new folder.\n    *   Update `HF_FILE` to the new filename.\n    *   Restart stack.\n2.  **Increasing Context Window**:\n    *   Set `CONTEXT_SIZE=16384` in `.env`.\n    *   **Warning**: Increases VRAM usage. Verify GPU capacity first.\n3.  **Debug Mode**:\n    *   Set `BRICKSLLM_MODE=development` in `.env`.\n    *   Enables verbose logging in the Go application.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n-   **Issue**: \"Variable not set\" error during startup.\n    *   **Fix**: Ensure you copied `.env.template` to `.env` and filled in all required fields.\n-   **Issue**: Changes in `.env` not reflecting.\n    *   **Fix**: You MUST run `./stop.sh` before `./start.sh`. Docker Compose often caches configuration if containers are just restarted.\n-   **Issue**: \"Password authentication failed\".\n    *   **Fix**: Mismatch between `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` in `.env` and the existing database volume. Run `docker volume rm bricksllm_postgresql_data` to reset the DB with the new password.\n\n## Production Deployment (Docker Compose)\n\n\n### Overview\n\nThe production Docker Compose setup provides a resource-efficient AI gateway stack with:\n\n- **Llama.cpp Server**: OpenAI-compatible inference server using GGUF models (CPU/GPU hybrid)\n- **BricksLLM**: AI gateway with rate limiting, cost tracking, and analytics\n- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for BricksLLM metadata\n- **Redis**: Caching layer for response caching and rate limiting\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Docker** 24.0+ with Compose V2\n- **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support (Recommended for speed)\n- **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** installed\n- **Local GGUF Model**: A quantized model file (e.g., `dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf`)\n\n### Quick Start\n\n1.  **Copy and configure the environment file**:\n    ```bash\n    cp .env.template .env\n    ```\n\n2.  **Edit `.env` with your settings**:\n    ```bash\n    # Llama.cpp Configuration\n    LLAMA_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda\n    LLAMA_HOST_PORT=5002\n    \n    # Model Configuration\n    HF_REPO=VRDate/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking-FP8-Q4_K_M-GGUF\n    HF_FILE=dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf\n    \n    # Local Model Path (Windows/WSL example)\n    LOCAL_MODEL_PATH=/mnt/c/Users/username/.lmstudio/models/...\n    \n    # Context Window\n    CONTEXT_SIZE=2048\n    ```\n\n3.  **Start the complete stack**:\n    ```bash\n    ./start.sh\n    ```\n\n    This script will:\n    -   Verify prerequisites and model existence\n    -   Start services (Llama.cpp, BricksLLM, Postgres, Redis)\n    -   Run health checks\n    -   Provide access URLs\n\n4.  **Verify the deployment**:\n    ```bash\n    ./test-stack.sh\n    ```\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     Docker Bridge Network                    │\n│                     (bricksllm-network)                      │\n│                                                               │\n│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐  │\n│  │  PostgreSQL  │    │    Redis     │    │  Llama.cpp   │  │\n│  │   (5433)     │◄───┤   (6380)     │◄───┤   (5002)     │  │\n│  │              │    │              │    │   + GPU      │  │\n│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘  │\n│         ▲                    ▲                    ▲         │\n│         │                    │                    │         │\n│         └────────────────────┼────────────────────┘         │\n│                              │                              │\n│                    ┌──────────────────┐                     │\n│                    │   BricksLLM      │                     │\n│                    │                  │                     │\n│                    │  Admin:   8001   │◄─── Management     │\n│                    │  Proxy:   8002   │◄─── Inference      │\n│                    └──────────────────┘                     │\n│                                                               │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Service Ports\n\n| Service       | Internal Port | Host Port | Purpose                          |\n|---------------|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------|\n| BricksLLM     | 8001          | 8001      | Admin API (provider settings)    |\n| BricksLLM     | 8002          | 8002      | Proxy API (inference requests)   |\n| Llama.cpp     | 5002          | 5002      | OpenAI-compatible inference API  |\n| Swagger UI    | 8080          | 8081      | API Documentation                |\n| Admin Panel   | 3000          | 3000      | Web UI for Management            |\n| PostgreSQL    | 5432          | 5433      | Database                         |\n| Redis         | 6379          | 6380      | Cache and rate limiting          |\n\n### Direct Model Access & Configuration\n\nThis section describes how to interact directly with the Llama.cpp inference server (port 5002) or via the BricksLLM proxy (port 8002).\n\n#### Authentication\n- **Llama.cpp (Direct)**: Supports `Authorization: Bearer <any-string>` (e.g., `sk-no-key-required`). The key itself is not validated by the server but the header is often required by clients.\n- **BricksLLM (Proxy)**: Requires a valid BricksLLM API key in the `Authorization: Bearer <your-key>` header.\n\n#### API Endpoint\n- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions` (Direct) or `http://localhost:8002/api/providers/openai/v1/chat/completions` (Proxy)\n\n#### Payload Configuration\nThe server accepts OpenAI-compatible chat completion payloads.\n\n**Required Fields:**\n- `model`: Model identifier (e.g., `dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf` or just `default`).\n- `messages`: Array of message objects with `role` and `content`.\n\n**Optional Fields:**\n- `stream`: Boolean (true/false) for streaming responses.\n- `temperature`: Controls randomness (0.0 to 2.0).\n- `max_tokens`: Limit generation length.\n\n#### Example Request\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer sk-no-key-required\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"default\",\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"Hello! Who are you?\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"stream\": false\n  }'\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nSending request to http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions...\n\n--- Model Response ---\n{\"id\":\"chatcmpl-...\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"created\":1715612345,\"model\":\"default\",\"choices\":[{\"index\":0,\"message\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"Hello!

This is useful for running custom models like DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking or any other model supported by vLLM.\n\n### Current Configuration\n\n**Provider Setting:**\n- **Provider**: vLLM\n- **URL**: `http://localhost:8000/v1`\n- **API Key**: `sk-no-key-required`\n- **Setting ID**: `0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a`\n\n**Bricks API Key:**\n- **Name**: DictaLM vLLM Key\n- **Key**: `dicta-vllm-key`\n- **Tags**: `[\"dicta\", \"vllm\"]`\n- **Rate Limit**: 100 requests/minute\n- **Cost Limit**: $10.00 USD\n- **Key ID**: `a70de8e0-f84d-44e4-b7d4-d80e0e1942bd`\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n#### 1. Start vLLM Server\nFirst, start your vLLM server with the DictaLM model:\n```bash\nvllm serve dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking \\\n  --enable-auto-tool-choice \\\n  --tool-call-parser hermes \\\n  --reasoning_parser deepseek_r1\n```\n\nThe vLLM server will run on `http://localhost:8000` by default.\n\n#### 2. Create Provider Setting\nCreate a provider setting that points to your vLLM server:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/provider-settings \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"provider\":\"vllm\",\n          \"setting\": {\n             \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/v1\",\n             \"apikey\": \"sk-no-key-required\"\n          }\n      }'\n```\n\nCopy the `id` from the response (e.g., `0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a`).\n\n**Note**: The URL should not have a trailing `/`.\n\n#### 3. Create Bricks API Key\nCreate an API key with rate limiting and cost controls:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/key-management/keys \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n\t      \"name\": \"DictaLM vLLM Key\",\n\t      \"key\": \"dicta-vllm-key\",\n\t      \"tags\": [\"dicta\", \"vllm\"],\n        \"settingIds\": [\"0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a\"],\n        \"rateLimitOverTime\": 100,\n        \"rateLimitUnit\": \"m\",\n        \"costLimitInUsd\": 10.0\n      }'\n```\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n#### Using cURL\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/providers/vllm/v1/chat/completions \\\n   -H \"Authorization: Bearer dicta-vllm-key\" \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"model\": \"dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking\",\n          \"messages\": [\n              {\n                  \"role\": \"user\",\n                  \"content\": \"Hello, how are you?\"\n              }\n          ]\n      }'\n```\n\n#### Using Python OpenAI SDK\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI(\n\tbase_url='http://localhost:8002/api/providers/vllm/v1',\n\tapi_key='dicta-vllm-key'\n)\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n\tmodel='dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking',\n\tmessages=[\n\t\t{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello, how are you?'}\n\t],\n)\n\nprint(response.choices[0].message.content)\n```\n\n#### Using JavaScript/TypeScript\n```javascript\nimport OpenAI from 'openai'\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n\tapiKey: 'dicta-vllm-key',\n\tbaseURL: 'http://localhost:8002/api/providers/vllm/v1',\n})\n\nconst response = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n\tmodel: 'dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking',\n\tmessages: [\n\t\t{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello, how are you?' }\n\t],\n})\n\nconsole.log(response.choices[0].message.content)\n```\n\n### Features Provided by BricksLLM\n\nWhen using BricksLLM as a proxy for your vLLM server, you get:\n\n1. **Rate Limiting**: Control requests per minute (100 req/min in current setup)\n2. **Cost Tracking**: Monitor and limit spending (up to $10 USD in current setup)\n3. **Request/Response Logging**: Track all API calls for analytics\n4. **API Key Management**: Secure access with custom API keys\n5. **Multi-Provider Support**: Easily switch between different vLLM deployments or other providers\n6. **Analytics & Reporting**: View usage metrics via admin API\n7. **Caching**: Optional response caching for identical requests\n8. **Failover & Retries**: Configure automatic retry logic and fallback providers\n\n### Monitoring & Management\n\n#### View Provider Settings\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8001/api/provider-settings\n```\n\n#### View API Keys\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8001/api/key-management/keys\n```\n\n#### View Events/Logs\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v2/events \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"tags\": [\"dicta\"]\n      }'\n```\n\n#### Update Rate Limits\n```bash\ncurl -X PATCH http://localhost:8001/api/key-management/keys/a70de8e0-f84d-44e4-b7d4-d80e0e1942bd \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"rateLimitOverTime\": 200,\n          \"rateLimitUnit\": \"m\"\n      }'\n```\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\n#### Multiple vLLM Instances\nYou can create multiple provider settings for different vLLM deployments:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/provider-settings \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"provider\":\"vllm\",\n          \"setting\": {\n             \"url\": \"http://localhost:8001/v1\",\n             \"apikey\": \"another-key\"\n          },\n          \"name\": \"vLLM Instance 2\"\n      }'\n```\n\n#### Model Restrictions\nRestrict which models can be accessed with a specific key:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/key-management/keys \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n\t      \"name\": \"Restricted Key\",\n\t      \"key\": \"restricted-vllm-key\",\n\t      \"tags\": [\"restricted\"],\n        \"settingIds\": [\"0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a\"],\n        \"allowedModels\": [\"dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking\"],\n        \"rateLimitOverTime\": 50,\n        \"rateLimitUnit\": \"m\"\n      }'\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### Connection Refused Error\nIf you get a \"Connection refused\" error when testing:\n1.

This mechanism is critical for enabling the model's reasoning capabilities (`<think>`) and tool-use functionalities.\n\n### Template Architecture (`chat_template.jinja2`)\n\nThe chat template defines the exact text format the model sees during inference. It transforms a list of abstract messages (System, User, Assistant, Tool) into a single prompt string that the model completes.\n\n#### 1. System Prompt Injection\nThe template logic prioritizes a dynamic system prompt but allows for a fallback injection via environment variables.\n\n**Logic Flow:**\n1.  **Check for User-Provided System Message:**\n    - If the first message in the conversation array (`messages[0]`) has the role `\"system\"`, its content is used as the `custom_instructions`.\n2.  **Fallback to Environment Variable:**\n    - If no system message is provided in the API call, the template inserts a placeholder: `__SYSTEM_PROMPT__`.\n    - **Injection Mechanism:** During container startup (`llama_entrypoint.sh`), this placeholder is replaced by the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` environment variable defined in your `.env` file.\n    - **Default Value:** If `SYSTEM_PROMPT` is unset, it defaults to `\"You are a helpful assistant.\"`.\n\n**Code Reference (`chat_template.jinja2.template`):**\n```jinja\n{#  ───── header (system message) ─────  #} \n{{- \"<|im_start|>system\\n\" -}} \n{%- if messages[0].role == \"system\" -%} \n    {%- set custom_instructions = messages[0].content.rstrip() -%} \n{%- endif -%} \n{%- if custom_instructions -%} \n    {{- custom_instructions -}} \n{%- else -%} \n    {{- \"__SYSTEM_PROMPT__\" -}} \n{%- endif -%}\n```\n\n#### 2. Tool Definition & Schema\nIf tools are provided in the API request, the template appends a structured XML definition to the system prompt. This teaches the model how to call functions.\n\n**Format:**\n```xml\n## Tools\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\nYou are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:\n<tools>\n{ \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"description\": \"...\", \"parameters\": { ... } }\n</tools>\nFor each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": <function-name>, \"arguments\": <args-json-object>}\n</tool_call>\n```\n\n#### 3. Message Formatting (ChatML)\nThe template uses the ChatML format (`<|im_start|>role\\ncontent<|im_end|>`) to structure the conversation history.\n\n-   **User Messages:** `<|im_start|>user\\nUser query...<|im_end|>`\n-   **Assistant Messages:** `<|im_start|>assistant\\nResponse...<|im_end|>`\n-   **Tool Outputs:** `<|im_start|>tool\\n<tool_response>\\nResult...\\n</tool_response><|im_end|>`\n\n#### 4. Reasoning & Thinking (`<think>`)\nThe template is designed to handle \"Chain of Thought\" reasoning. The model is instructed (via the system prompt) to wrap its internal reasoning process in `<think>` tags.\n\n**Assistant Generation Logic:**\n-   The template attempts to separate `reasoning_content` from the final response.\n-   If the model outputs `<think>...</think>`, the template preserves this structure so clients (like the frontend) can parse and visualize the reasoning separately from the final answer.\n\n**Code Reference (`chat_template.jinja2.template`):**\n```jinja\n{%- if \"</think>\" in content -%} \n    {%- set reasoning_content = content.split(\"</think>\")[0].rstrip(\"\\n\").split(\"<think>\")[-1].lstrip(\"\\n\") -%} \n    {%- set content = content.split(\"</think>\")[-1].lstrip(\"\\n\") -%} \n{%- endif -%}\n{{- \"\\n<|im_start|>\" + message.role + \"\\n<think>\" + reasoning_content.strip(\"\\n\") + \"</think>\" + content.lstrip(\"\\n\") -}} \n```\n\n### User-Assistant Interaction Mechanism\n\n#### 1. Request Flow\n1.  **Frontend/Client**: Sends a standard OpenAI-compatible JSON payload (messages, tools, etc.) to BricksLLM (`port 8002`).\n2.  **BricksLLM Proxy**: Forward the request to the `llama-server` (`port 5002`).\n3.  **Llama Server**:\n    -   Loads the `chat_template.jinja2` file.\n    -   Processes the `messages` array through the template.\n    -   Replaces `__SYSTEM_PROMPT__` with the injected value if no system message exists.\n    -   Generates a single raw string prompt.\n    -   Feeds this prompt to the DictaLM model.\n\n#### 2. Response Construction\n1.  **Thinking Phase**: The model generates a `<think>` block containing its reasoning steps.\n2.  **Tool Call Phase (Optional)**: If a tool is needed, the model outputs a `<tool_call>` XML block instead of text.\n3.  **Final Answer Phase**: After reasoning (and potential tool execution), the model generates the final response text.\n4.  **Client Parsing**: The frontend detects these tags to render the UI components (Reasoning bubble, Tool invocation, Final answer).\n\n### Environment Variable Injection (`.env`)\n\nThe system relies on the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` variable to define the model's base personality and capabilities.\n\n-   **File**: `.env`\n-   **Variable**: `SYSTEM_PROMPT`\n-   **Injection Point**: `llama_entrypoint.sh`\n-   **Usage**:\n    -   At container startup, `llama_entrypoint.sh` reads `chat_template.jinja2.template`.\n    -   It replaces the literal string `__SYSTEM_PROMPT__` with the value of `$SYSTEM_PROMPT`.\n    -   The result is saved as `chat_template.jinja2`, which `llama-server` uses for every request.\n\n**Example `.env` Configuration:**\n```bash\nSYSTEM_PROMPT=\"You are DictaLM, a helpful AI assistant. When answering, you MUST first provide your internal reasoning or thought process wrapped in <think> tags, followed by your final response to the user outside the tags.\"\n```\n\n## Frontend Documentation\n\n\n### Overview\nThe BricksLLM frontend is a lightweight, single-page application (SPA) designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the BricksLLM gateway and the underlying DictaLM model. It provides a chat interface that supports reasoning visualization (via `<think>` tags) and integrates directly with the BricksLLM proxy.\n\n### Architecture\n\n#### Core Components\n- **HTML (`index.html`)**: Defines the structure of the chat interface, including the sidebar, chat panel, and input area. It loads the `index.js` script with a version query parameter for cache busting.\n- **CSS (`style.css`)**: Handles styling, implementing a dark-themed, professional UI with responsive design elements.\n- **JavaScript (`index.js`)**: Contains the application logic, including message rendering, API interaction, and response parsing.\n- **Docker**: The frontend is containerized using `node:18-alpine` and served via `http-server`.\n\n#### Message Rendering Logic\nThe frontend uses a custom rendering function `appendMessage` to display chat bubbles. It supports:\n- **Reasoning Separation**: Detects `<think>` tags in the assistant's response and renders the reasoning content separately from the final answer.\n- **System Context Stripping**: Uses regex (`leakagePattern`) to remove any leaked system context from the model's output (e.g., \"The user says... The system context...\").\n- **Typing Indicators**: Displays a typing animation while waiting for the model's response.\n- **Role-Based Styling**: Differentiates between user and assistant messages visually.\n\n### API Integration\n\n#### Configuration\nThe frontend uses the following hardcoded configuration to connect to the BricksLLM proxy. These settings match the custom provider and key configured in the backend.\n\n**Provider Setting (Custom):**\n- **Provider Name**: `llama-cpp-root`\n- **URL**: `http://llama-server:5002`\n- **Setting ID**: (Auto-generated by setup script)\n\n**API Key:**\n- **Key**: `sk-bricksllm-frontend-llama-key-explicit`\n- **Name**: `Frontend Llama Key`\n- **Allowed Path**: `/chat/completions`\n\n#### Endpoint\nThe frontend communicates with the BricksLLM proxy via the following endpoint:\n- **URL**: `http://localhost:8002/api/custom/providers/llama-cpp-root/chat/completions`\n- **Method**: `POST`\n- **Headers**:\n  - `Authorization`: `Bearer sk-bricksllm-frontend-llama-key-explicit` (Key configured for the custom provider)\n  - `Content-Type`: `application/json`\n\n#### Payload\nThe frontend sends a standard OpenAI-compatible chat completion payload:\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are DictaLM, a helpful AI assistant. When answering, you MUST first provide your internal reasoning or thought process wrapped in <think> tags...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"User input here\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Deployment\n\n#### Docker Configuration\nThe frontend is defined as a service in `docker-compose.yml`:\n- **Image**: `node:18-alpine`\n- **Container Name**: `bricksllm-frontend`\n- **Port Mapping**: Host port `8003` -> Container port `8003`\n- **Volume**: Binds the local `frontend` directory to `/app` in the container for hot-reloading.\n\n#### Development Mode (Hot Reload)\n- **Command**: The container runs a shell command that checks `NODE_ENV`.\n  - If `development`: Runs `bun run build` (updates cache version) and starts `http-server` with caching disabled (`-c-1`).\n  - If `production`: Starts `http-server` with default caching.\n- **Environment Variable**: `NODE_ENV=development` is set in `docker-compose.yml` to enable hot-reloading behavior.\n\n#### Cache Management\n- **Automatic Versioning**: The `npm run build` script automatically updates the `index.js` version query parameter in `index.html` using a timestamp (`v=$(date +%s)`).\n- **No-Cache Server**: In development, `http-server` is run with `-c-1` to prevent browser caching of static assets.\n\n### Key Code Snippets\n\n#### Response Parsing (`index.js`)\n```javascript\n// Check for <think> tags\nconst thinkMatch = reply.match(/<think>([\\s\\S]*?)<\\/think>/);\nif (thinkMatch) {\n    const thinkContent = thinkMatch[1].trim();\n    // Render thinking content...\n}\n\n// Clean up potential system context leakage\nconst leakagePattern = /The user says \".*?\"\\. The system context: .*?\\. So respond with .*?\\./s;\ncontent = content.replace(leakagePattern, '').trim();\n```\n\n#### Build Script (`package.json`)\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"bun x http-server -p 8003 -c-1\",\n  \"build\": \"sed -i \\\"s/index.js?v=[^\\\"]*/index.js?v=$(date +%s)/\\\" index.html\"\n}\n```\n\n\n      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks.

The key is systematic verification, external memory storage, and healthy skepticism about our own assumptions.\n\n\nContents of /home/ilan/BricksLLM/CLAUDE.md (project instructions, checked into the codebase):\n\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to CLAUDE (claude.ai) when working with code in this repository.\n\n## Project Overview\n\n**BricksLLM** is a specialized, cloud-native AI gateway optimized for the local deployment and management of the **DictaLM-3.0** model. This project provides a complete, containerized infrastructure that orchestrates:\n\n-   **DictaLM-3.0 Inference**: Runs the `dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf` model via a dedicated `llama-server` container (Dockerized Llama.cpp with CUDA support).\n-   **AI Gateway**: A Go-based proxy that manages rate limiting, cost control, caching, and API key authentication between clients and the model.\n-   **Frontend Demo**: A lightweight, hot-reloading chat interface for interacting with DictaLM, demonstrating reasoning capabilities (`<think>` tags) and tool use.\n-   **Data Persistence**: PostgreSQL and Redis containers for storing configuration, logs, and cache data.\n\nThis setup is specifically designed for local usage, leveraging Docker Compose to spin up the entire stack with a single command. It acts as a production-ready template for deploying DictaLM with enterprise-grade management features.\n\n## Server Management Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Stop Before Start\nTo ensure a clean state and prevent \"Address already in use\" errors (especially with port bindings like 8003 or 5002), strict server management discipline is enforced.\n\n**Protocol:**\nBefore executing the `start.sh` script or any command that starts server services (like `docker compose up`), you **MUST ALWAYS** first stop any running server instances.\n\n**Required Workflow:**\n1.  Execute `./stop.sh` to tear down existing containers and networks.\n2.  Execute `./start.sh` to initialize the stack.\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\n./stop.sh  # Cleans up old containers and releases ports\n./start.sh # Starts the fresh stack\n```\n\n**Rationale:**\nThis prevents port binding conflicts and ensures that configuration changes (like volume bindings, environment variables, or hot-reload settings) are correctly applied to recreated containers.\n\n## Technical Stack & Operations Guide\n\n### 1. Stack Deployment Process\n\nThe deployment is orchestrated by the `start.sh` script, which ensures a consistent and error-free initialization of the environment using Docker Compose.\n\n**Deployment Sequence:**\n1.  **Prerequisite Validation**: Checks for Docker, NVIDIA drivers (for GPU support), and essential configuration files (`.env`, `docker-compose.yml`).\n2.  **Resource Check**: Verifies available GPU resources and disk space to ensure the model can be loaded.\n3.  **Configuration Validation**: Ensures all required environment variables are set in `.env`.\n4.  **Service Initialization**:\n    -   Executes `docker compose up -d` to start the backend services (`postgresql`, `redis`, `llama-server`, `bricksllm`, `swagger-ui`).\n    -   Starts the frontend container (`frontend`).\n5.  **Health Verification**:\n    -   Polls the health endpoints of each service (`pg_isready`, `redis-cli ping`, `curl health`).\n    -   **Critical Step**: Waits for `llama-server` to fully load the DictaLM model into memory (indicated by a healthy HTTP 200 response).\n6.  **Integration Testing**: Runs a suite of internal tests (`test-stack.sh`) to verify connectivity between the proxy, the model, and the database.\n7.  **Access Information**: Prints the available URLs for all services.\n\n### 2. Container Configuration\n\nThe stack runs on a custom Docker bridge network (`bricksllm-network`), enabling secure internal communication.\n\n| Service | Container Name | Host Port | Internal Port | Purpose |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Frontend** | `bricksllm-frontend` | `8003` | `8003` | User Chat Interface (Hot-reload enabled in dev) |\n| **BricksLLM Admin** | `bricksllm-gateway` | `8001` | `8001` | Management API (Keys, Providers, Settings) |\n| **BricksLLM Proxy** | `bricksllm-gateway` | `8002` | `8002` | AI Gateway Proxy (Rate limiting, Logging) |\n| **Llama Server** | `bricksllm-llama` | `5002` | `5002` | DictaLM Inference Engine (CUDA accelerated) |\n| **PostgreSQL** | `bricksllm-postgresql`| `5433` | `5432` | Primary Database |\n| **Redis** | `bricksllm-redis` | `6380` | `6379` | High-speed Cache & Rate Limiter |\n| **Swagger UI** | `bricksllm-swagger` | `8082` | `8080` | API Documentation Viewer |\n\n### 3. Service Endpoints\n\n#### Frontend UI\n-   **URL**: `http://localhost:8003`\n-   **Access**: Browser-based chat interface.\n\n#### BricksLLM Proxy API\nThe primary entry point for AI applications.\n-   **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8002`\n-   **Auth**: Bearer Token (API Key required)\n-   **Key Endpoint**: \n    -   `POST /api/custom/providers/llama-cpp-root/chat/completions`\n    -   **Payload**: OpenAI-compatible JSON (messages, model, tools).\n    -   **Response**: Streaming or JSON completion with `<think>` tags.\n\n#### BricksLLM Admin API\nUsed for configuration and management.\n-   **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8001`\n-   **Auth**: None (Local default) / Configurable\n-   **Key Endpoints**:\n    -   `GET /api/health`: System health status.\n    -   `PUT /api/key-management/keys`: Create/Update API keys.\n    -   `PUT /api/provider-settings`: Configure LLM providers.\n    -   `GET /api/events`: Retrieve usage logs and analytics.\n\n#### Llama Server (Direct)\nDirect access to the model (bypassing the gateway).\n-   **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5002`\n-   **Endpoint**: `POST /v1/chat/completions`\n-   **Auth**: Bearer token (optional/ignored by default server config, but header may be required).\n\n### 4. Model Loading Process\n\n**Mechanism**:\nUpon container start, the `llama-server` maps the GGUF model file from the host filesystem to the container and begins loading it into GPU VRAM (and system RAM if VRAM is insufficient).\n\n**Timing & Readiness**:\n-   **Duration**: Typically **10-45 seconds**, depending on disk speed (NVMe recommended) and model size (24B parameters).\n-   **Readiness Check**: The container will report as \"healthy\" only when the model is fully loaded and the HTTP server is accepting requests.\n\n> **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:**\n> **DO NOT** attempt to interact with the frontend or API endpoints until the `start.sh` script explicitly reports that all services are **HEALTHY**.\n> Premature interaction while the model is loading will result in `Connection Refused` or `502 Bad Gateway` errors and may require a stack restart.\n\n### 5. Operational Considerations\n\n**System Requirements**:\n-   **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with **16GB+ VRAM** (24GB recommended for full offload of the 24B parameter model).\n-   **RAM**: 32GB+ System RAM (if partial CPU offloading is required).\n-   **Disk**: Fast NVMe SSD (critical for model loading times).\n\n**Performance**:\n-   **Inference**: The system uses `llama.cpp` with CUDA acceleration. Performance scales with the number of GPU layers offloaded (`--n-gpu-layers`).\n-   **Context Window**: Default configured to 8192 tokens. Increasing this will significantly increase VRAM usage.\n\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Two-Server Design\nThe application runs two HTTP servers simultaneously:\n- **Admin Server** (port 8001): Management API for keys, provider settings, routes, policies, events, and reporting\n- **Proxy Server** (port 8002): Handles actual LLM API requests, enforces rate/cost limits, and proxies to providers\n\nBoth servers are started from `cmd/bricksllm/main.go` and run concurrently.\n\n### Core Components\n\n**Manager Layer** (`internal/manager/`)\n- Coordinates between storage, caches, and business logic\n- `Manager`: Key management with validation and cache invalidation\n- `ReportingManager`: Analytics and event aggregation  \n- `ProviderSettingsManager`: Provider configuration with optional encryption\n- `RouteManager`: Custom routing with failover/retry logic\n- `PolicyManager`: Access control policies\n- `UserManager`: Per-user rate/cost limits\n\n**Provider Implementations** (`internal/provider/`)\n- Each provider has its own package: `openai/`, `anthropic/`, `azure/`, `vllm/`, `deepinfra/`, `custom/`\n- Token counting and cost estimation are provider-specific\n- Providers use shared `Setting` struct for configuration\n\n**Storage Layer** (`internal/storage/`)\n- `postgresql/`: Primary persistent storage (keys, settings, events, users, policies, routes)\n- `redis/`: Multiple Redis databases (0-10) for different caches (rate limits, cost limits, API cache, access cache, provider settings cache, keys cache)\n- `memdb/`: In-memory caches that poll PostgreSQL at configurable intervals (`IN_MEMORY_DB_UPDATE_INTERVAL`, default 5s) for custom providers and routes\n\n**Routing & Failover** (`internal/route/`)\n- `Route` struct defines multi-step execution with provider failover\n- Each `Step` can specify retries, timeout, model override, and request parameter overrides\n- Supports exponential or constant backoff strategies\n- Routes are stored in PostgreSQL and cached in memdb\n\n**Event System** (`internal/message/`, `internal/event/`)\n- Message bus pattern with pub/sub for async event processing\n- `Consumer` runs multiple goroutines (default 3, configurable via `NUMBER_OF_EVENT_MESSAGE_CONSUMERS`) to handle events\n- Events track request/response data, latency, cost, and tokens for analytics\n\n**Additional Features**\n- `internal/authenticator/`: Key validation and provider setting lookup\n- `internal/validator/`: Rate limit and cost limit enforcement\n- `internal/recorder/`: Records usage metrics to Redis and PostgreSQL\n- `internal/pii/`: PII detection using AWS Comprehend\n- `internal/policy/`: Custom policies for content filtering (uses OpenAI for detection)\n- `internal/encryptor/`: Optional encryption for sensitive settings\n\n### Database Schema\nTables are created/migrated on startup in `cmd/bricksllm/main.go`:\n- `keys`: API keys with rate/cost limits, tags, allowed paths/models\n- `provider_settings`: Provider API keys and configuration\n- `custom_providers`: Custom provider endpoints\n- `routes`: Multi-step routing configurations\n- `events`: Individual API request logs\n- `events_by_day`: Aggregated daily metrics (with unique index on keyId/day/provider/model)\n- `policies`: Access control rules\n- `users`: User-level rate/cost limits\n\n## Environment Variables Configuration\n\nThis section comprehensively documents the environment variables used to configure the BricksLLM stack. These variables are primarily defined in the `.env` file and consumed by Docker Compose to orchestrate the services.\n\n### 1. Variable Reference Table\n\n| Variable Name | Default Value | Required | Purpose | Used In |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **PostgreSQL** | | | | |\n| `POSTGRESQL_USERNAME` | `postgres` | Yes | Database user for BricksLLM metadata. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` | `postgres` | Yes | Database password. **Security Warning: Change in production.** | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `POSTGRESQL_DB` | `bricksllm` | Yes | Name of the database to create/use. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `POSTGRESQL_HOST_PORT` | `5433` | Yes | Host port mapping for PostgreSQL. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| **Redis** | | | | |\n| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | (Complex String) | Yes | Password for Redis authentication. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `REDIS_HOST_PORT` | `6380` | Yes | Host port mapping for Redis. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| **Llama Server** | | | | |\n| `LLAMA_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda` | Yes | Docker image for the inference engine. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `LLAMA_HOST_PORT` | `5002` | Yes | Host port for direct model access. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `HF_FILE` | `dictalm...gguf` | Yes | Filename of the GGUF model to load. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `LOCAL_MODEL_PATH` | `./models` | Yes | Host path containing the model file. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `CONTEXT_SIZE` | `8192` | No | Context window size in tokens. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `N_GPU_LAYERS` | `99` | No | Number of layers to offload to GPU. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `SYSTEM_PROMPT` | \"You are DictaLM...\" | No | Base system instruction injected into the chat template. | `.env`, `llama_entrypoint.sh` |\n| **BricksLLM Gateway** | | | | |\n| `BRICKSLLM_MODE` | `production` | Yes | Operational mode (`development` or `production`). | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `BRICKSLLM_ADMIN_PORT`| `8001` | Yes | Host port for the Admin API. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `BRICKSLLM_PROXY_PORT`| `8002` | Yes | Host port for the Proxy API. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n| `IN_MEMORY_DB_UPDATE_INTERVAL` | `5s` | No | Sync frequency between Redis/MemDB and Postgres. | `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` |\n\n### 2. Configuration Logic & Flow\n\n#### Loading Hierarchy\n1.  **`.env` File**: The primary source of truth. Docker Compose automatically reads this file to populate variable substitutions (e.g., `${VARIABLE}`).\n2.  **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines how these variables are passed to containers.\n    *   **Direct Mapping**: `ports: - '${LLAMA_HOST_PORT:-5002}:5002'` (Uses default if env var is missing).\n    *   **Environment Section**: `environment: SYSTEM_PROMPT: ${SYSTEM_PROMPT}` (Passes value into container).\n3.  **Application Code**:\n    *   **BricksLLM (Go)**: Uses `internal/config` to load variables via the `koanf` library.\n    *   **Llama Server (Bash)**: Uses `llama_entrypoint.sh` to read `$SYSTEM_PROMPT` and inject it into the Jinja template.\n\n#### Frontend Inheritance\nThe Frontend container (`bricksllm-frontend`) does **not** directly inherit variables from `.env`. Instead, it relies on:\n-   **Hardcoded API Configuration**: `index.js` points to `http://localhost:8002`.\n-   **Docker Network**: Resolves internal hostnames (`bricksllm-gateway`, `llama-server`) via the bridge network.\n-   **`NODE_ENV`**: Passed explicitly in `docker-compose.yml` to control hot-reloading.\n\n#### Security Considerations\n-   **Secrets**: `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` and `REDIS_PASSWORD` are visible in `.env`. For production, use Docker Swarm Secrets or a vault.\n-   **Git**: Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore` (use `.env.template` for version control).\n\n### 3. Code References\n\n**Go Configuration Loading (`internal/config/config.go`):**\n```go\ntype Config struct {\n    PostgresqlUsername string `koanf:\"postgresql_username\" env:\"POSTGRESQL_USERNAME\"`\n    PostgresqlPassword string `koanf:\"postgresql_password\" env:\"POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD\"`\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**System Prompt Injection (`llama_entrypoint.sh`):**\n```bash\n# Default if unset\nif [ -z \"$SYSTEM_PROMPT\" ]; then\n    export SYSTEM_PROMPT=\"You are a helpful assistant.\"\nfi\n\n# Template substitution\nESCAPED_PROMPT=${SYSTEM_PROMPT//\\\"/\\\\\\\"}\nFINAL_TEMPLATE=\"${TEMPLATE/__SYSTEM_PROMPT__/$ESCAPED_PROMPT}\"\n```\n\n### 4. Operational Details\n\n#### Overriding Variables\n-   **Temporary Override**: `SYSTEM_PROMPT=\"New Prompt\" ./start.sh` (Shell environment takes precedence).\n-   **Permanent Change**: Edit `.env` and run `./stop.sh && ./start.sh`.\n\n#### Common Scenarios\n1.  **Changing Model**:\n    *   Update `LOCAL_MODEL_PATH` to the new folder.\n    *   Update `HF_FILE` to the new filename.\n    *   Restart stack.\n2.  **Increasing Context Window**:\n    *   Set `CONTEXT_SIZE=16384` in `.env`.\n    *   **Warning**: Increases VRAM usage. Verify GPU capacity first.\n3.  **Debug Mode**:\n    *   Set `BRICKSLLM_MODE=development` in `.env`.\n    *   Enables verbose logging in the Go application.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n-   **Issue**: \"Variable not set\" error during startup.\n    *   **Fix**: Ensure you copied `.env.template` to `.env` and filled in all required fields.\n-   **Issue**: Changes in `.env` not reflecting.\n    *   **Fix**: You MUST run `./stop.sh` before `./start.sh`. Docker Compose often caches configuration if containers are just restarted.\n-   **Issue**: \"Password authentication failed\".\n    *   **Fix**: Mismatch between `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` in `.env` and the existing database volume. Run `docker volume rm bricksllm_postgresql_data` to reset the DB with the new password.\n\n## Production Deployment (Docker Compose)\n\n\n### Overview\n\nThe production Docker Compose setup provides a resource-efficient AI gateway stack with:\n\n- **Llama.cpp Server**: OpenAI-compatible inference server using GGUF models (CPU/GPU hybrid)\n- **BricksLLM**: AI gateway with rate limiting, cost tracking, and analytics\n- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for BricksLLM metadata\n- **Redis**: Caching layer for response caching and rate limiting\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Docker** 24.0+ with Compose V2\n- **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support (Recommended for speed)\n- **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** installed\n- **Local GGUF Model**: A quantized model file (e.g., `dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf`)\n\n### Quick Start\n\n1.  **Copy and configure the environment file**:\n    ```bash\n    cp .env.template .env\n    ```\n\n2.  **Edit `.env` with your settings**:\n    ```bash\n    # Llama.cpp Configuration\n    LLAMA_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda\n    LLAMA_HOST_PORT=5002\n    \n    # Model Configuration\n    HF_REPO=VRDate/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking-FP8-Q4_K_M-GGUF\n    HF_FILE=dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf\n    \n    # Local Model Path (Windows/WSL example)\n    LOCAL_MODEL_PATH=/mnt/c/Users/username/.lmstudio/models/...\n    \n    # Context Window\n    CONTEXT_SIZE=2048\n    ```\n\n3.  **Start the complete stack**:\n    ```bash\n    ./start.sh\n    ```\n\n    This script will:\n    -   Verify prerequisites and model existence\n    -   Start services (Llama.cpp, BricksLLM, Postgres, Redis)\n    -   Run health checks\n    -   Provide access URLs\n\n4.  **Verify the deployment**:\n    ```bash\n    ./test-stack.sh\n    ```\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     Docker Bridge Network                    │\n│                     (bricksllm-network)                      │\n│                                                               │\n│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐  │\n│  │  PostgreSQL  │    │    Redis     │    │  Llama.cpp   │  │\n│  │   (5433)     │◄───┤   (6380)     │◄───┤   (5002)     │  │\n│  │              │    │              │    │   + GPU      │  │\n│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘  │\n│         ▲                    ▲                    ▲         │\n│         │                    │                    │         │\n│         └────────────────────┼────────────────────┘         │\n│                              │                              │\n│                    ┌──────────────────┐                     │\n│                    │   BricksLLM      │                     │\n│                    │                  │                     │\n│                    │  Admin:   8001   │◄─── Management     │\n│                    │  Proxy:   8002   │◄─── Inference      │\n│                    └──────────────────┘                     │\n│                                                               │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Service Ports\n\n| Service       | Internal Port | Host Port | Purpose                          |\n|---------------|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------|\n| BricksLLM     | 8001          | 8001      | Admin API (provider settings)    |\n| BricksLLM     | 8002          | 8002      | Proxy API (inference requests)   |\n| Llama.cpp     | 5002          | 5002      | OpenAI-compatible inference API  |\n| Swagger UI    | 8080          | 8081      | API Documentation                |\n| Admin Panel   | 3000          | 3000      | Web UI for Management            |\n| PostgreSQL    | 5432          | 5433      | Database                         |\n| Redis         | 6379          | 6380      | Cache and rate limiting          |\n\n### Direct Model Access & Configuration\n\nThis section describes how to interact directly with the Llama.cpp inference server (port 5002) or via the BricksLLM proxy (port 8002).\n\n#### Authentication\n- **Llama.cpp (Direct)**: Supports `Authorization: Bearer <any-string>` (e.g., `sk-no-key-required`). The key itself is not validated by the server but the header is often required by clients.\n- **BricksLLM (Proxy)**: Requires a valid BricksLLM API key in the `Authorization: Bearer <your-key>` header.\n\n#### API Endpoint\n- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions` (Direct) or `http://localhost:8002/api/providers/openai/v1/chat/completions` (Proxy)\n\n#### Payload Configuration\nThe server accepts OpenAI-compatible chat completion payloads.\n\n**Required Fields:**\n- `model`: Model identifier (e.g., `dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf` or just `default`).\n- `messages`: Array of message objects with `role` and `content`.\n\n**Optional Fields:**\n- `stream`: Boolean (true/false) for streaming responses.\n- `temperature`: Controls randomness (0.0 to 2.0).\n- `max_tokens`: Limit generation length.\n\n#### Example Request\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer sk-no-key-required\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"default\",\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"Hello! Who are you?\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"stream\": false\n  }'\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nSending request to http://localhost:5002/v1/chat/completions...\n\n--- Model Response ---\n{\"id\":\"chatcmpl-...\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"created\":1715612345,\"model\":\"default\",\"choices\":[{\"index\":0,\"message\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"Hello!

This is useful for running custom models like DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking or any other model supported by vLLM.\n\n### Current Configuration\n\n**Provider Setting:**\n- **Provider**: vLLM\n- **URL**: `http://localhost:8000/v1`\n- **API Key**: `sk-no-key-required`\n- **Setting ID**: `0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a`\n\n**Bricks API Key:**\n- **Name**: DictaLM vLLM Key\n- **Key**: `dicta-vllm-key`\n- **Tags**: `[\"dicta\", \"vllm\"]`\n- **Rate Limit**: 100 requests/minute\n- **Cost Limit**: $10.00 USD\n- **Key ID**: `a70de8e0-f84d-44e4-b7d4-d80e0e1942bd`\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n#### 1. Start vLLM Server\nFirst, start your vLLM server with the DictaLM model:\n```bash\nvllm serve dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking \\\n  --enable-auto-tool-choice \\\n  --tool-call-parser hermes \\\n  --reasoning_parser deepseek_r1\n```\n\nThe vLLM server will run on `http://localhost:8000` by default.\n\n#### 2. Create Provider Setting\nCreate a provider setting that points to your vLLM server:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/provider-settings \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"provider\":\"vllm\",\n          \"setting\": {\n             \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/v1\",\n             \"apikey\": \"sk-no-key-required\"\n          }\n      }'\n```\n\nCopy the `id` from the response (e.g., `0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a`).\n\n**Note**: The URL should not have a trailing `/`.\n\n#### 3. Create Bricks API Key\nCreate an API key with rate limiting and cost controls:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/key-management/keys \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n\t      \"name\": \"DictaLM vLLM Key\",\n\t      \"key\": \"dicta-vllm-key\",\n\t      \"tags\": [\"dicta\", \"vllm\"],\n        \"settingIds\": [\"0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a\"],\n        \"rateLimitOverTime\": 100,\n        \"rateLimitUnit\": \"m\",\n        \"costLimitInUsd\": 10.0\n      }'\n```\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n#### Using cURL\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/providers/vllm/v1/chat/completions \\\n   -H \"Authorization: Bearer dicta-vllm-key\" \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"model\": \"dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking\",\n          \"messages\": [\n              {\n                  \"role\": \"user\",\n                  \"content\": \"Hello, how are you?\"\n              }\n          ]\n      }'\n```\n\n#### Using Python OpenAI SDK\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI(\n\tbase_url='http://localhost:8002/api/providers/vllm/v1',\n\tapi_key='dicta-vllm-key'\n)\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n\tmodel='dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking',\n\tmessages=[\n\t\t{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello, how are you?'}\n\t],\n)\n\nprint(response.choices[0].message.content)\n```\n\n#### Using JavaScript/TypeScript\n```javascript\nimport OpenAI from 'openai'\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n\tapiKey: 'dicta-vllm-key',\n\tbaseURL: 'http://localhost:8002/api/providers/vllm/v1',\n})\n\nconst response = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n\tmodel: 'dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking',\n\tmessages: [\n\t\t{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello, how are you?' }\n\t],\n})\n\nconsole.log(response.choices[0].message.content)\n```\n\n### Features Provided by BricksLLM\n\nWhen using BricksLLM as a proxy for your vLLM server, you get:\n\n1. **Rate Limiting**: Control requests per minute (100 req/min in current setup)\n2. **Cost Tracking**: Monitor and limit spending (up to $10 USD in current setup)\n3. **Request/Response Logging**: Track all API calls for analytics\n4. **API Key Management**: Secure access with custom API keys\n5. **Multi-Provider Support**: Easily switch between different vLLM deployments or other providers\n6. **Analytics & Reporting**: View usage metrics via admin API\n7. **Caching**: Optional response caching for identical requests\n8. **Failover & Retries**: Configure automatic retry logic and fallback providers\n\n### Monitoring & Management\n\n#### View Provider Settings\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8001/api/provider-settings\n```\n\n#### View API Keys\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8001/api/key-management/keys\n```\n\n#### View Events/Logs\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v2/events \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"tags\": [\"dicta\"]\n      }'\n```\n\n#### Update Rate Limits\n```bash\ncurl -X PATCH http://localhost:8001/api/key-management/keys/a70de8e0-f84d-44e4-b7d4-d80e0e1942bd \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"rateLimitOverTime\": 200,\n          \"rateLimitUnit\": \"m\"\n      }'\n```\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\n#### Multiple vLLM Instances\nYou can create multiple provider settings for different vLLM deployments:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/provider-settings \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n          \"provider\":\"vllm\",\n          \"setting\": {\n             \"url\": \"http://localhost:8001/v1\",\n             \"apikey\": \"another-key\"\n          },\n          \"name\": \"vLLM Instance 2\"\n      }'\n```\n\n#### Model Restrictions\nRestrict which models can be accessed with a specific key:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/key-management/keys \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   -d '{\n\t      \"name\": \"Restricted Key\",\n\t      \"key\": \"restricted-vllm-key\",\n\t      \"tags\": [\"restricted\"],\n        \"settingIds\": [\"0d36ec30-749f-4cd7-b151-21a831aa834a\"],\n        \"allowedModels\": [\"dicta-il/DictaLM-3.0-24B-Thinking\"],\n        \"rateLimitOverTime\": 50,\n        \"rateLimitUnit\": \"m\"\n      }'\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### Connection Refused Error\nIf you get a \"Connection refused\" error when testing:\n1.

This mechanism is critical for enabling the model's reasoning capabilities (`<think>`) and tool-use functionalities.\n\n### Template Architecture (`chat_template.jinja2`)\n\nThe chat template defines the exact text format the model sees during inference. It transforms a list of abstract messages (System, User, Assistant, Tool) into a single prompt string that the model completes.\n\n#### 1. System Prompt Injection\nThe template logic prioritizes a dynamic system prompt but allows for a fallback injection via environment variables.\n\n**Logic Flow:**\n1.  **Check for User-Provided System Message:**\n    - If the first message in the conversation array (`messages[0]`) has the role `\"system\"`, its content is used as the `custom_instructions`.\n2.  **Fallback to Environment Variable:**\n    - If no system message is provided in the API call, the template inserts a placeholder: `__SYSTEM_PROMPT__`.\n    - **Injection Mechanism:** During container startup (`llama_entrypoint.sh`), this placeholder is replaced by the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` environment variable defined in your `.env` file.\n    - **Default Value:** If `SYSTEM_PROMPT` is unset, it defaults to `\"You are a helpful assistant.\"`.\n\n**Code Reference (`chat_template.jinja2.template`):**\n```jinja\n{#  ───── header (system message) ─────  #} \n{{- \"<|im_start|>system\\n\" -}} \n{%- if messages[0].role == \"system\" -%} \n    {%- set custom_instructions = messages[0].content.rstrip() -%} \n{%- endif -%} \n{%- if custom_instructions -%} \n    {{- custom_instructions -}} \n{%- else -%} \n    {{- \"__SYSTEM_PROMPT__\" -}} \n{%- endif -%}\n```\n\n#### 2. Tool Definition & Schema\nIf tools are provided in the API request, the template appends a structured XML definition to the system prompt. This teaches the model how to call functions.\n\n**Format:**\n```xml\n## Tools\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\nYou are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:\n<tools>\n{ \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"description\": \"...\", \"parameters\": { ... } }\n</tools>\nFor each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": <function-name>, \"arguments\": <args-json-object>}\n</tool_call>\n```\n\n#### 3. Message Formatting (ChatML)\nThe template uses the ChatML format (`<|im_start|>role\\ncontent<|im_end|>`) to structure the conversation history.\n\n-   **User Messages:** `<|im_start|>user\\nUser query...<|im_end|>`\n-   **Assistant Messages:** `<|im_start|>assistant\\nResponse...<|im_end|>`\n-   **Tool Outputs:** `<|im_start|>tool\\n<tool_response>\\nResult...\\n</tool_response><|im_end|>`\n\n#### 4. Reasoning & Thinking (`<think>`)\nThe template is designed to handle \"Chain of Thought\" reasoning. The model is instructed (via the system prompt) to wrap its internal reasoning process in `<think>` tags.\n\n**Assistant Generation Logic:**\n-   The template attempts to separate `reasoning_content` from the final response.\n-   If the model outputs `<think>...</think>`, the template preserves this structure so clients (like the frontend) can parse and visualize the reasoning separately from the final answer.\n\n**Code Reference (`chat_template.jinja2.template`):**\n```jinja\n{%- if \"</think>\" in content -%} \n    {%- set reasoning_content = content.split(\"</think>\")[0].rstrip(\"\\n\").split(\"<think>\")[-1].lstrip(\"\\n\") -%} \n    {%- set content = content.split(\"</think>\")[-1].lstrip(\"\\n\") -%} \n{%- endif -%}\n{{- \"\\n<|im_start|>\" + message.role + \"\\n<think>\" + reasoning_content.strip(\"\\n\") + \"</think>\" + content.lstrip(\"\\n\") -}} \n```\n\n### User-Assistant Interaction Mechanism\n\n#### 1. Request Flow\n1.  **Frontend/Client**: Sends a standard OpenAI-compatible JSON payload (messages, tools, etc.) to BricksLLM (`port 8002`).\n2.  **BricksLLM Proxy**: Forward the request to the `llama-server` (`port 5002`).\n3.  **Llama Server**:\n    -   Loads the `chat_template.jinja2` file.\n    -   Processes the `messages` array through the template.\n    -   Replaces `__SYSTEM_PROMPT__` with the injected value if no system message exists.\n    -   Generates a single raw string prompt.\n    -   Feeds this prompt to the DictaLM model.\n\n#### 2. Response Construction\n1.  **Thinking Phase**: The model generates a `<think>` block containing its reasoning steps.\n2.  **Tool Call Phase (Optional)**: If a tool is needed, the model outputs a `<tool_call>` XML block instead of text.\n3.  **Final Answer Phase**: After reasoning (and potential tool execution), the model generates the final response text.\n4.  **Client Parsing**: The frontend detects these tags to render the UI components (Reasoning bubble, Tool invocation, Final answer).\n\n### Environment Variable Injection (`.env`)\n\nThe system relies on the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` variable to define the model's base personality and capabilities.\n\n-   **File**: `.env`\n-   **Variable**: `SYSTEM_PROMPT`\n-   **Injection Point**: `llama_entrypoint.sh`\n-   **Usage**:\n    -   At container startup, `llama_entrypoint.sh` reads `chat_template.jinja2.template`.\n    -   It replaces the literal string `__SYSTEM_PROMPT__` with the value of `$SYSTEM_PROMPT`.\n    -   The result is saved as `chat_template.jinja2`, which `llama-server` uses for every request.\n\n**Example `.env` Configuration:**\n```bash\nSYSTEM_PROMPT=\"You are DictaLM, a helpful AI assistant. When answering, you MUST first provide your internal reasoning or thought process wrapped in <think> tags, followed by your final response to the user outside the tags.\"\n```\n\n## Frontend Documentation\n\n\n### Overview\nThe BricksLLM frontend is a lightweight, single-page application (SPA) designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the BricksLLM gateway and the underlying DictaLM model. It provides a chat interface that supports reasoning visualization (via `<think>` tags) and integrates directly with the BricksLLM proxy.\n\n### Architecture\n\n#### Core Components\n- **HTML (`index.html`)**: Defines the structure of the chat interface, including the sidebar, chat panel, and input area. It loads the `index.js` script with a version query parameter for cache busting.\n- **CSS (`style.css`)**: Handles styling, implementing a dark-themed, professional UI with responsive design elements.\n- **JavaScript (`index.js`)**: Contains the application logic, including message rendering, API interaction, and response parsing.\n- **Docker**: The frontend is containerized using `node:18-alpine` and served via `http-server`.\n\n#### Message Rendering Logic\nThe frontend uses a custom rendering function `appendMessage` to display chat bubbles. It supports:\n- **Reasoning Separation**: Detects `<think>` tags in the assistant's response and renders the reasoning content separately from the final answer.\n- **System Context Stripping**: Uses regex (`leakagePattern`) to remove any leaked system context from the model's output (e.g., \"The user says... The system context...\").\n- **Typing Indicators**: Displays a typing animation while waiting for the model's response.\n- **Role-Based Styling**: Differentiates between user and assistant messages visually.\n\n### API Integration\n\n#### Configuration\nThe frontend uses the following hardcoded configuration to connect to the BricksLLM proxy. These settings match the custom provider and key configured in the backend.\n\n**Provider Setting (Custom):**\n- **Provider Name**: `llama-cpp-root`\n- **URL**: `http://llama-server:5002`\n- **Setting ID**: (Auto-generated by setup script)\n\n**API Key:**\n- **Key**: `sk-bricksllm-frontend-llama-key-explicit`\n- **Name**: `Frontend Llama Key`\n- **Allowed Path**: `/chat/completions`\n\n#### Endpoint\nThe frontend communicates with the BricksLLM proxy via the following endpoint:\n- **URL**: `http://localhost:8002/api/custom/providers/llama-cpp-root/chat/completions`\n- **Method**: `POST`\n- **Headers**:\n  - `Authorization`: `Bearer sk-bricksllm-frontend-llama-key-explicit` (Key configured for the custom provider)\n  - `Content-Type`: `application/json`\n\n#### Payload\nThe frontend sends a standard OpenAI-compatible chat completion payload:\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"dictalm-3.0-24b-thinking-fp8-q4_k_m.gguf\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are DictaLM, a helpful AI assistant. When answering, you MUST first provide your internal reasoning or thought process wrapped in <think> tags...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"User input here\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Deployment\n\n#### Docker Configuration\nThe frontend is defined as a service in `docker-compose.yml`:\n- **Image**: `node:18-alpine`\n- **Container Name**: `bricksllm-frontend`\n- **Port Mapping**: Host port `8003` -> Container port `8003`\n- **Volume**: Binds the local `frontend` directory to `/app` in the container for hot-reloading.\n\n#### Development Mode (Hot Reload)\n- **Command**: The container runs a shell command that checks `NODE_ENV`.\n  - If `development`: Runs `bun run build` (updates cache version) and starts `http-server` with caching disabled (`-c-1`).\n  - If `production`: Starts `http-server` with default caching.\n- **Environment Variable**: `NODE_ENV=development` is set in `docker-compose.yml` to enable hot-reloading behavior.\n\n#### Cache Management\n- **Automatic Versioning**: The `npm run build` script automatically updates the `index.js` version query parameter in `index.html` using a timestamp (`v=$(date +%s)`).\n- **No-Cache Server**: In development, `http-server` is run with `-c-1` to prevent browser caching of static assets.\n\n### Key Code Snippets\n\n#### Response Parsing (`index.js`)\n```javascript\n// Check for <think> tags\nconst thinkMatch = reply.match(/<think>([\\s\\S]*?)<\\/think>/);\nif (thinkMatch) {\n    const thinkContent = thinkMatch[1].trim();\n    // Render thinking content...\n}\n\n// Clean up potential system context leakage\nconst leakagePattern = /The user says \".*?\"\\. The system context: .*?\\. So respond with .*?\\./s;\ncontent = content.replace(leakagePattern, '').trim();\n```\n\n#### Build Script (`package.json`)\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"bun x http-server -p 8003 -c-1\",\n  \"build\": \"sed -i \\\"s/index.js?v=[^\\\"]*/index.js?v=$(date +%s)/\\\" index.html\"\n}\n```\n\n\n      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context unless it is highly relevant to your task.\n</system-reminder>\n"},{"type":"text","text":"Warmup","cache_control":{"type":"ephemeral"}}]}],"system":[{"type":"text","text":"You are Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude.","cache_control":{"type":"ephemeral"}},{"type":"text","text":"You are a file search specialist for Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude.

Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nAvailable agent types and the tools they have access to:\n\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use AgentOutputTool to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run - When you need their results to continue you can use AgentOutputTool in blocking mode to pause and wait for their results.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- Agents with \"access to current context\" can see the full conversation history before the tool call. When using these agents, you can write concise prompts that reference earlier context (e.g., \"investigate the error discussed above\") instead of repeating information. The agent will receive all prior messages and understand the context.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a code-reviewer agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example_agent_descriptions>\n\"code-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done writing a signficant piece of code\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\n</example_agent_description>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a signficant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent \n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Hello\"\n<commentary>\nSince the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the greeting-responder agent\"\n</example>\n","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"description":{"type":"string","description":"A short (3-5 word) description of the task"},"prompt":{"type":"string","description":"The task for the agent to perform"},"subagent_type":{"type":"string","description":"The type of specialized agent to use for this task"},"model":{"type":"string","enum":["sonnet","opus","haiku"],"description":"Optional model to use for this agent.

Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use `ls foo` to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - You can use the `run_in_background` parameter to run the command in the background, which allows you to continue working while the command runs. You can monitor the output using the Bash tool as it becomes available. You do not need to use '&' at the end of the command when using this parameter.\n  \n  - Avoid using Bash with the `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:\n    - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)\n    - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)\n    - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)\n    - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)\n    - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\n  - When issuing multiple commands:\n    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n    - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp, Write before Bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n    - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nOnly create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\nGit Safety Protocol:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them \n- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it\n- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it\n- Avoid git commit --amend.  ONLY use --amend when either (1) user explicitly requested amend OR (2) adding edits from pre-commit hook (additional instructions below) \n- Before amending: ALWAYS check authorship (git log -1 --format='%an %ae')\n- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.\n   Note: git status depends on the commit completing, so run it sequentially after the commit.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry ONCE. If it succeeds but files were modified by the hook, verify it's safe to amend:\n   - Check HEAD commit: git log -1 --format='[%h] (%an <%ae>) %s'. VERIFY it matches your commit\n   - Check not pushed: git status shows \"Your branch is ahead\"\n   - If both true: amend your commit. Otherwise: create NEW commit (never amend other developers' commits)\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git bash commands\n- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases.

You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implementing memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Adding virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimizing image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fixing state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Reviewing bundle size and implementing code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}}]}},"response":{"timestamp":1765288036.996,"status_code":200,"headers":{"anthropic-organization-id":"88700ae0-7492-4337-866b-f86cb4c32876","cf-cache-status":"DYNAMIC","cf-ray":"9ab4f4110dbcdc03-TLV","connection":"keep-alive","content-length":"22","content-type":"application/json","date":"Tue, 09 Dec 2025 13:47:16 GMT","request-id":"req_011CVwDXyXqAadvuAgrXTmdP","server":"cloudflare","strict-transport-security":"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload","x-envoy-upstream-service-time":"158","x-robots-tag":"none"},"body":{"input_tokens":19622}},"logged_at":"2025-12-09T13:47:16.996Z"}
